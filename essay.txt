Shy Goodarzi prioritizes based on what will advance critical monthly goals, considering business context, mandates, team support, and objectives ().

You should review Gemini's notes to make sure they're accurate. Please provide feedback about using Gemini to take notes in a üìñ Transcript Jun 3, 2025 Manager Tooling UXR - Transcript 00:00:00 Shy Goodarzi: Okay. So, you ready? Yes. Can you describe your current role and what your team is responsible for? Deep. Um, so current role, I help lead our key accounts teams within customer success. We are responsible for leading the adoption and maturity for our topline revenue for the company. which means it's focused to about 13 to 14 specific key accounts. our top paying customers within BetterUp. And our goal is to not only incubate and innovate on what does the future of platform delivery and adoption and value realization look like for better up but it's also to help us understand in this new way of platform for better up what does that mean to what our customers require of us long term. Yeah. Is that helpful? Yes. and very important work. Yes. Um to be more specific, it spans across four teams. Okay. Um customer success managers, client delivery directors, specialized IPMs, and um solution engineers. And we sit from pre-sales to post sales across our key account segment. 00:01:24 Shy Goodarzi: Yes. I really hope you grow your team, please. Um how long have you been in a manage management role? This company or just overall? Overall, seven years. Okay. And currently, how many people do you manage?

10. And are they is it a mix of IC's and managers or one or the other? All IC's. All IC's. Great. Um, and have you managed in other organizations? Clearly, you've managed in other organizations before. If so, how does this experience compare? I would say that based off the stage of the company that we are in, our scope as leaders is very wide, which means we're solving for a lot more problems. Um, there's pros and cons to that. Pros, you get a much wider view into what's happening on the ground level in terms of what's going on with the business and with your teams. I think the cons of that is you struggle to prioritize what problems to solve. Yeah. 00:02:37 Shy Goodarzi: And my experience here so far is that people are very willing, very open to solving a lot of problems. We sometimes don't know how to communicate what problem we're solving for and who's responsible for it. So I think my experience overall as I'm speaking out loud and brainstorming and venting yes feels like we need to do a better job of getting crystal clear on who is solving for the problem. We all know the problems that exist. Yeah. But who ising for the problem? Yeah. And how are we investing in it is the question that I ask myself as a leader here more than I did at previous companies. you know, previous companies because of the stage. Again, we're series E, but we we kind of operate like a series A. Um, series B. I series A, not series A. Series A is like Yeah, series B. Sorry, I don't need like series B. Um, is in other companies when I'm in those positions, it's been we're investing in these directions. Here's how we need to go and execute for the most part. 00:03:46 Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. And here it's we're figuring out still what we're investing in because our product is not sticky enough. So let's go and bring back the data which is a sticky which is like a it's a it's a cloudy space to be in and it's also not a space for everybody to be into. Totally. So like you also have to recognize as a leader once you're in that position is this is this the position I want to be into? Totally. So yes. Yes. Yeah. Um, okay. Zooming out more to kind of understanding current challenges. Can you tell me what the top two to three challenges you face as a manager right now? Capacity and prioritization. Amazing. And how can you tell me a little bit more about what like those challenges specifically? Yeah, I mean best practices any leader shouldn't have anywhere from should only have five to six IC's max. Um, also one to two functions. Yes, I have I have over those by double. 00:04:46 Shy Goodarzi: Yes. So, four functions, 10 people. Oh my gosh.

So, that's the capacity issue which means that your team engagement results like PCON will be poor in management support because they don't feel like they have enough of your time. Yeah. That's also a skill problem sometimes because obviously some of your IC's are better at reaching out and communicating versus some are not. But it's also on an organization to invest in developing your people. So it's not unfair feedback. Okay. Um so that's the capacity piece. In terms of prioritization, when you have four functions across pre-to post sales and again your breadth is very large, you have to be very targeted every week on like what problem you're not solving for, just inching along totally to solve for like it's not even solving for it. It's just like how do we how do we just make 0.5% of a step here? Um, yeah. And I think those are the two that you wrestle with. Okay. 00:05:42 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Um, are there particular areas of your team's performance or development that you feel hardest to influence? Oo, that's a great question. Hardest to influence meaning I feel like I don't have enough influence to grow these areas. Yes. Or you feel like you don't have the tools or support to be able to do that? No, I actually don't think so. Not me. Not me personally. I feel that I have I work with a lot of con conviction once I make a decision. And I don't really let the boundaries of a corporate company tell me what those things are. I just need to do what needs to be done. Yeah. So, I don't really feel that way. Yeah. Um I also feel like as a leader, if you don't have tools, you kind of create the tools that you need. Yeah. So, have you done like have you built any tools for yourself or have you kind of yeah hacked stuff together to get what you need? 00:06:47 Shy Goodarzi: This is exposing some good qu this is like it's making me think about good things because I think key accounts is so innovative in services that we don't really have standard ways yet of doing things. So I haven't been building tools per se, but building this is what the process should be and communicating it out and allowing the teams to have the autonomy to build the right tools to support them. Okay. And not being very directive and we have to choose one or the other. Let's more be playful about what we're building. Here's the outcome we're trying to drive for. Great. What I thought about when you asked that was more like upward feedback. Yes. And that's not about tools. It's just about being very honest and directive about what you need. And that's where I feel like I don't need don't need any Okay. tools or help with. Okay. Does that make sense? It does. It does. It

does. 00:07:36 Shy Goodarzi: Um, what do you currently spend the most time on that you feel is low value? Um I think at our stage of company like dealing with people's comp if pay is actually right and captivate if we're like it's these operational things that should not be time sucks for us like I shouldn't have CSM holding a manual spreadsheet of their opportunities doing their manual calcul calcated commission and prospect referencing their paychecks for that. Wow. That's like and and dealing with things like that is not obviously a great use of time. So like little operational things. Okay. I would say probably for the purpose of this question. Yeah. Um I was initially going to say prioritizing my time because of workload and amount of people but I actually think it's a good exercise for me actually week in and week out to do. I think what is low value is like choosing what meeting to be every day. Like every morning I'll wake up and I'll spend 30 minutes like what meetings do I decline? 00:08:49 Shy Goodarzi: What meetings do I actually attend? Yes. If I had priorities set automatically each week and it did it for me. Whoa. That's a tool. Product idea. That's a tool. Nailed it. That would be incredible. Okay. Um today, how do you go about prioritizing? Like do you just like think about it? make a list for yourself like that kind of thing. I go back to the question of what's going to push the needle on the thing that needs to push in this month. Okay. So, I think about the weeks and milestones. So, if I know I'll think about it in milestones and then in my in my team like who needs me this week? Who needs to see me? Who needs to get my guidance? Like who's asked for support, eyes, hands, ears, and in what areas. Okay. Um, I also try and cross reference that with where we are within the business. 00:09:42 Shy Goodarzi: So, if Disney feels, okay, we just launched, I can kind of take my foot off the gas at Disney and not join because I have Jess in these calls and yada yada. Yes. I'm dare to like I I'll kind of do the weighing of four things as I talk about this. Business context Uhhuh. versus business mandate. Okay. Team support. Okay. And then final is like objectives we're trying to push towards. Those four will probably dictate how I prioritize in the morning. Okay. And that's like a jazz balance. I think. Yes. And do you do it at the beginning of the week or do you do it every day? Fridays I do for Monday, Tuesday, and then by Monday morning I probably have to rechange everything. Okay. Because something's come up for Wednesday through Friday. So, I try not to do the entire week because I know things are going to

change and it's a waste of time. 00:10:36 Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Yeah. So helpful. Um, how do you ensure your team is aligned with broader company goals? Um, consistent communication in one-on- ones and team meetings. Okay. And you, so you host like a weekly I have a weekly team. I have a bi-weekly team meeting right now. Okay. Which I if you have to constantly reinforce your company's vision, there's a problem every two weeks. The line. So, I try not to actually speak about it more than once a month in team settings because we should be aligned on what we talked about last month. Totally. In one-on- ones, I always try and connect their individual goals to the broader, you know, missions of the company. Totally. Which is why it comes up more in one-on-one settings. Okay. I also find it more beneficial to have in one-on-one conversations because there's more uh space for to talk and discuss the ideas themselves because the objectives or missions of a company are just ideas. 00:11:28 Shy Goodarzi: They're not fact. So, yes. Amazing. Um, what are the biggest communication hurdles you face with your team and other teams? Communication hurdles, if you have any like in terms of timing, in terms of how I communicate, all any any of those. I don't really, as you can tell, I don't have time with communication as much. I know. I was gonna say I feel like I can talk all day. Um and there's no topic I can't I don't feel like is I can't talk about um just because it comes from a always comes from a very light place. Yeah. So I don't really have any communication with my with my team other teams. Yeah. Yeah. Not even no I feel like I can talk to other teams too but same way. I I will corroborate that from my perspective. Absolutely. Um how do you uh currently support the growth and development of your team members? So, it's I I I do it in two ways. 00:12:30 Shy Goodarzi: The first way is in our first one-on ones that I have a direct report, right? Because direct reports change here a lot in some cases. Every time I'm doing like our first one-on-one, I'm always trying to get gain insight into the person, okay? Not the professional yet. Because I want to understand what motivates them, what they're inspired by, what their passions are. I think if you can understand that better, you have a better question to ask towards the end of that when we talk about career goals of like what do you want to do here? Like what do you want to accomplish? Not the role. What do you want to accomplish? So I'll typically try and probe into those areas. Over the next set of one-on- ones, my asks will be like, "What do you want to do? And are you doing the things to

be able to It's very coaching, right, of what we do. Yeah. Are you doing the things that are helping you get there?" And 00:13:13 Shy Goodarzi: like, "How can I be hands or eyes or ears to help you get there?" Mhm. And typically once we have that, we'll typically lay out a road map for six months, nine months. Okay. Based off of what you're doing, here are the two areas it's going to help you in your career goals, help you in your aspirations. Here are not the areas that are going to. Yeah. So, here are the areas I should probably be a lot more involved with. Yeah. And the other areas actually don't really matter as much. Yeah. Um, so we'll just basically build a plan against that and we'll constantly just check in on like how I'll check in on how they're feeling towards accomplishing those goals. Yeah, doesn't happen all the time. Um, but I try and keep a very like open door if things come up outside of the one-on- ones to talk about it. Yeah. Um, I also just have a philosophy and like this is like some really interesting data that um 84% of the people that manage their one-on- ones, like they lead their one-on- ones with their leadership feel like they have more fulfillment in their jobs. 00:14:08 Shy Goodarzi: Interesting. So, I I don't like to I don't like to prescribe anything in our one-on- ones. I like to see how people show up. Oh, totally. And that actually gives me a much better indication of if they should be there or not. Totally. Um, is there anything that makes giving feedback, managing performance, or having career conversations challenging today? Not to me. Yeah. Passing with flying colors. Um, okay. Oh, here we go. I think we're getting kicked out. No worries. Um, it'll keep going. Yes. Okay. Okay. I'm going to move to the tooling and support needs. Okay. What tools do you currently use to manage your team? What tools do I currently use to manage my team? Vitaly. What's that? Vital is our customer success platform. It's okay. We just rolled it out. We just rolled it out probably a few months ago. 00:15:20 Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Or two months ago. Um, Vitaly Salesforce. Um, we have some Excel sheets that we use to manage like deployments and things of that nature, but typically vitally and Salesforce is where the majority of all of our account data lives. Okay. That tells me what we need to tell me where like all the account specific information is. Yeah. I don't track at a micro level tasks and like project management stuff. I don't project manage our because also within key accounts you have our most senior more strategic. Yes. You don't have to handhold. You shouldn't have to shouldn't have to handhold. Yeah. So I don't I don't handhold. We unless you sense unless the

caveat is like I sense I need to inspect. Okay. So that's what I want to get into. How do you know that some like what are the signals that you're gathering and where is that data for you to know when something maybe isn't going as planned or when it is? 00:16:24 Shy Goodarzi: when risk bubbled up of fire when fires happen, I'll inspect a little bit more. Two, I don't hear from someone in a couple weeks. If I don't hear from you in a few weeks, I don't hear like, "Here's what's going on here." Just like kind of communicating, I'll I'll say like, "Why are going on?" Okay. Why haven't I heard from you in a few weeks? Okay. Usually is a telling sign of like things are something's weird. Something's off. Okay. And is there a tool that you currently use, whether it's a spreadsheet or something else, that you feel is incredibly helpful to you? my notebook. I'm very like I'm I don't I don't really use a tool. That's so interesting. I don't really use a Do other managers use tools? Should I be using a tool? Did I fail? Did I fail on this one? You know, I'm like, okay, so in this world of AI, right, part of how helpful it can be is the data that you can give to it. 00:17:14 Shy Goodarzi: Yes. And when it's all in this notebook, does that make everything more manual for you? No. Because when I'm managing people, I don't think there's I'll eat my own words later, but um I don't think I need a database of like information to tell me how to like manage a person. Okay. When it gets to that level. Okay. Does that make sense? It does. It does. Yeah. I will say though, so this is probably more helpful. Yeah. In another organization where I had layers, I had directors underneath me with other teams. Okay. I use tools like a sauna and things like that. Okay. To at a broader scale be able to understand what people are working on and inspect in those ways, right? But now you're at this. Okay. If I showed you what was in vitally, vital is a pretty good indicator indicator of like team performance, who's working on what. Also in this context for the recording, yeah, being in the retention business, being in the NR business, yeah, your work is dictated by your book. 00:18:23 Shy Goodarzi: Y your book is dictated by your expansion opportunities. So like you kind of know where work should be okay pushed into. Yeah. Um yeah, I'm just going to make a note because this is this is making me think about something now. Okay, great. And I love this. You have such nice handwriting. I do. Thank you, Shy. What? That is great. Thank you. I appreciate it. Okay. So, it sounds like you answered this question. Do you

have access to the kind of data you need to manage effectively? And you're saying you have that. Okay. I do. Um, are there any kinds of insights or reports that would help you be a better manager? Yes. Let's talk about it. Yes. If I had I would love more of a real time pulse on how my teams are feeling. Not peon results that are once a quarter, okay? 00:19:25 Shy Goodarzi: But like true honest like we we get on Friday team calls and it's Friday and it's happy Friday two check-in and people are like tired or like energetic or and like that's great but I get it. It's a team call. We're rah rahrrah on Friday. Totally. I would love an honest real time pulse on how people are feeling and what they need. Okay. So I can be more proactive about long-term support. Okay. Um, I don't know how we we would do that. Um, I think that's also kind of your job as a manager to be able to kind of sense how the team is. Yeah. Um, a better report. I'm thinking more better up specific, but like pacing like how are we pacing against the goals? Yeah. and pacing against the outcomes we set at the beginning of the year or beginning of the quarter or like we pace in these metrics that are connected to the organization which are great I think that's easy through line yeah but are there other like opfs other performance factors that we have that we should be tracking against I think there are like in large organizations there always are totally but the way they track them is opaque yeah so I that would be okay that would be helpful but it comes back to our previous conversation of prioritization and time like what problems are we solving for Like we have like Yeah. 00:20:44 Shy Goodarzi: If I'm a If I'm a CS leader, Yeah. I'm probably focused on just expanding my book. Totally. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Um, a couple more questions for you. If you could design a tool just for managers, what would it help you do? Prioritize their time automatically. I liked that idea we talked about earlier. Yeah. Um, or well, it's prioritize their time. Mhm. Yeah. Or help them identify where they are spending too much time. You mean as a manager? Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. I noticed you were in Yes. 60% of your meetings this week were in Disney. Should you be focused there? I love this. Any other thoughts there? Yeah. Like like kind of pushing you. Yeah. Like it'd be nice to have a almost like a coach to push you on like where you're spending your time. Time's the most. 00:21:37 Shy Goodarzi: I mean, this is very time. It's time. Time for managers at your level. It's like that's the number one. Number one. Okay. Um, are there any changes or innovations

in the way teams are managed that you'd like to see your company adopt? Yes. Tell me more. I have a demo actually with Superblocks in three weeks. Superblocks is a company that I don't know about the rails, but essentially what they do is they're like an internal service layer or internal interface to all of the applications that are within an organization. Okay. And you can build automations and process workflows with just gender like just prompts. Wow. So I can say like I use vital Salesforce and this for this process. Build me an app for this and it'll build the like. So, I think what I'd love to do is figure out I mean this is being recorded but like yeah I can also turn it off if you want to and I don't have to like it's not it it wouldn't record but I'd have the idea and I wouldn't link it back to you. 00:22:41 Shy Goodarzi: Okay. If you can Yeah. Um okay last question and then um I think that is it but um how like are you currently using AI in managing how so? Um I use chat I mean I use AI to do a few things bounce off my own communication talk track ideas on how I communicate the ideas to like performance reviews one-on- ones things like that. Yeah. Um, I use it to build storylines of how I frame and set up context to meetings. If I'm kicking off a meeting, I'll use it to like help me understand how to frame this in a way the audience. So, I'll say I have a product person, a salesperson, and a leader in the call. Here's my talk track. How would I reframe it to make sure that they all feel like they're seen and part of the conversation? So, I do it to really test my own thinking. Okay. Um, I'll then do it to do a lot of like research on companies, get up to date on like how I'm thinking about the future of how things are going to be architected. 00:24:13 Shy Goodarzi: Um, and then lastly, I'll stress test it on um my own like automations. Like I'll build like little small automations to help me like manage my inbox or manage like things that are being very cluttered. Okay, that's the way that I use it today. And what do you use? ChatGpt, Gemini. I'll use Zapier because Zapier is just like an easy way to just connect certain tools to um that's really what I use today. I mean the thing about a leader like I think there's types of leaders in departments. Product leaders for example are still very hands-on like they still have to get a lot of hands-on work done. I do as well, but it's more it's more relational work. Yes. It's like clearing the way. Yeah. It's like clearing the way or it's like customer work.

It's not like I'm not building reports every day. I'm not um I'm not in the better platform and admin panel. I'm not like I'm not in those things. 00:25:23 Shy Goodarzi: I'm assessing and viewing and yes figuring out how to architect and doing org design and like but yeah, you know what I mean? Like that work is like so like I don't know it's relational. Yeah. If I really got like I don't know how GBT would do that work. Yeah. Like I the end work but the brainstorm discovery to that is very Yeah. Like it's very it's very discovery and very blocked by other people's times. I can't just go do it right now. I want to do it in a day. Like I I have I got to be with Brian in a few days. I gota be like I just I walked all by other people's times. So um okay final question then we will end this. This is the most this was like the this is it. Fantastic. Um is there anything else you would want to share in this line of thinking around manager tooling? Manager tooling. What else I would share? 00:26:27 Shy Goodarzi: Um, I think flow of work for managers is is going to be your key to adoption. If I'm on I'm on the road. I got to go from flight to flight. I got to go from phone to laptop. Phone like, you know, a laptop speaker and camera to off to like Yeah. If I think about how I just navigate my own technology, yeah, how it seamlessly funnels through that I think is the company that figures out flow of work for managers in manager tooling will win. Okay, that's I I strongly believe that because I always think about like sometimes I won't answer something on Slack on the road because I know I have two minutes to get somewhere and this might take five minutes. it telling I'll just wait like all like damn like Patrick Pinky, but I know Patrick's pings are this long so I need to yes. Wait till I get to a laptop. Yeah. But what if I didn't? Yeah, would I be able to continue my train of thought from like easily seamlessly? Just begin to it, just stick it. Yeah I mean so okay. Um well thank you so much. Yeah, no problem. This is the best. Transcription ended after 00:27:47 This editable transcript was computer generated and might contain errors.

They are also working on fostering team culture in a remote setting and addressing communication hurdles by encouraging solution-oriented approaches. Mitchell Amoros Estefan is focused

on team development through regular check-ins, managing expectations around promotions with guidance from Lola, and leveraging AI to improve team efficiency and data analysis. Details Team Overview and Responsibilities Mitchell Amoros Estefan leads the implementation services team (IM), which consists of five implementation project managers and three technical implementation project managers. The IM team acts as the crucial link between pre-sales and post-sales, taking the promised value and delivering it to customers before handing them off to customer success managers. Mitchell Amoros Estefan emphasizes the team's vital role in establishing strong initial customer relationships (). Management Experience and Team Dynamics Mitchell Amoros Estefan has 13 years of management experience and currently manages eight individual contributors (). They noted that this experience is similar to past roles, but this team has faced challenges due to frequent organizational shifts, leading to a lack of clarity about their function (). Mitchell Amoros Estefan has focused on improving the team's perception within the company and breaking down an "us versus them" mentality fostered by previous management (). Key Managerial Challenges Mitchell Amoros Estefan identified capacity and workload as significant challenges for the implementation team due to the fast-paced environment and competing priorities. Another key challenge is enablement, as there isn't a dedicated enablement organization supporting their team despite them being at the forefront of experiencing product changes (). Mitchell Amoros Estefan is also working to shift the team's mindset away from feeling misunderstood or undervalued (). Influencing Team Performance and Development Mitchell Amoros Estefan finds it challenging to influence the team's experience with multi-product launches due to the newness and the historically individualistic nature of their products (). To address this, they encourage the team to recognize individual product launches as multi-product experiences (). Mitchell Amoros Estefan also focuses on fostering team culture in a geographically dispersed team and aims to create a space for more creativity (). Time Spent on Low-Value Tasks Mitchell Amoros Estefan spends a significant amount of time manually assigning every incoming launch case, which is time-consuming for them and their colleagues (). Additionally, the lack of readily available data for the implementation team necessitates manual reporting on key metrics like time to value and program health (). Mitchell Amoros Estefan is exploring if Vitaly can help automate some of this reporting (). Communication Hurdles Mitchell Amoros Estefan highlighted the communication challenges arising from the fast-paced nature of their work, often leading to urgent requests that disrupt team members' planned schedules ().

Shy Goodarzi: about you, current challenges and understand u more about that. So starting off really basic um can you describe your current role and what your team is responsible for? Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Yeah. So I head up the implementation services team or IM team. Um, and I oversee our five implementation project managers and our three technical implementation project managers. Though we have one tip that is on leave until March of 2026. Shy Goodarzi: Oh my gosh. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um, which is a challenge in itself. sort of capacity planning and all of that for for sort of long leaves. And we have an organization that everyone uh is wonderfully having babies, which means that we're in constant planning mode as leaders Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: and as managers Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: um and sort of planning for the future. 00:00:56 Mitchell Amoros

Estefan: Um and so, you know, our team is really the connectors between pre and post sales. Um we take the vision, the dream, the um sort of value delivery that has been promised um in the sales process and and deliver on it um for our customers before fully handing off to our customer success managers that really own the endto-end experience um and getting the customer through you know all of those activations later on. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um I love to say that we have kind of the most important role in the organization because um you really make or break a relationship in Shy Goodarzi: thous%. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: the first few days. Shy Goodarzi: A thousand%. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: and so yeah, so the team the team is in charge of that. I I on a regular basis it's like understanding where um everyone's capacity is planning for our future strategy. How are we handling the current issues that are sort of popping up? Shy Goodarzi: Absolutely. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um how am I managing competing priorities within the organization? 00:01:55 Mitchell Amoros Estefan: um ensuring that they're not being pulled in too many different directions though you know where we are right now it it ends up happening a little bit um you know and and managing the expectations of both the pre and post sales organizations and internally of like what we're actually capable of doing um with the time that we have Shy Goodarzi: Absolutely. And how long have you been in a management role generally, not just here? Mitchell Amoros Estefan: um like 13 years Shy Goodarzi: Wow. Wow. And how many people do you currently manage? I Mitchell Amoros Estefan: eight. Shy Goodarzi: think you mentioned this. Eight. Okay. And do you It sounds like they're all IC's. Is that right? Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Yes, they're all individual Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: computers. Yeah, Shy Goodarzi: Super helpful. And h if it sounds like you've managed in in other organizations before. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: I have Shy Goodarzi: If so, how does this compare this experience? Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Oh, that's interesting. 00:02:42 Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um, this is How does this compare? Um, you know, it's it's interesting. I have lived under customer success organizations. I've I've I've been in customer success slashimplementation world for my entire career, but really in this like professional services implementation for the last like seven or eight years. Um, and I would say that this like I'm trying to figure out how to like word this properly. Um, from a management perspective, it's not like massively different. I Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: think, um, there are some key components of making sure that we're meeting the like the needs of our our individual team members and making sure that like we're like, you know, lading up to the overall

goals of the organization. Those are all sort of like the normal things. I think um this team has been moved around a lot to Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: within this company which leads to people having like an unclear picture Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: of what we do 00:03:49 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: generally sort of minimizing minimizing it down to oh you like gather information and that's Shy Goodarzi: Right. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: it versus your so there's there I've spent the last 10 months trying to do a better job of um being PR for the organization Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Mitchell Amoros Estefan: um in different meetings and showing up differently than previous managers. Um so I think the other thing that I would say is like a little bit different um is and no no knock on on previous managers of the implementation team um they were born from the organization and Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: when you're a new manager the and and you sometimes have worked with your peers as like a onetoone it Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: can be really difficult to um step out of that. Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Yes. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um it's hard for people to look at you in a different way and hard for Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: you to be a different way because you have to start to recognize um I can't be their friend in the 00:04:47 Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: same way. Shy Goodarzi: Absolutely. Absolutely. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um and previous managers I think had a harder time with that. And so what it ended up becoming was insular Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: and creating an us versus them mentality. And I've had to Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: sort of break this us Shy Goodarzi: That Mitchell Amoros Estefan: versus them mentality. And I think that that has been difficult for the team at moments. they're frustrated with me that I'm not like more like hey Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Mitchell Amoros Estefan: like it's us against the world, right? Like Shy Goodarzi: totally. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: hate that. Um Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: but it's not helpful and and Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: then we become the organization that's always saying no or that like they're the bad guys and we're the good guys and Shy Goodarzi: Right. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: like that's not helpful Shy Goodarzi: That's also Mitchell Amoros Estefan: and Shy Goodarzi: not helpful. 00:05:23 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: yeah, so Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: you're you're not leading into a collaborative space that way. So that's been um not that that's like abnormal. I've been through this before, but it is um it is very prevalent here. Sure. Shy Goodarzi: So interesting. Um if we take a step back, what are the

two to three, if if that exists, challenges that you face as a manager right now? Mitchell Amoros Estefan: um in general or with the team like with like specifically on implementation Shy Goodarzi: with the team like of as a manager of like Mitchell Amoros Estefan: the implementation teams Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yes. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: specifically implementation Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: um you know I don't think this is necessarily unique but capacity and workload um we're just moving at a million miles an hour um and there are competing priorities I think um in that same vein um enablement is difficult. We don't have a core enablement organization that is like supporting the implementation team even though we are the people who are sort of experiencing all of the things. 00:06:20 Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um and so you know you've seen it with manage and like how we're sort of trying to like work Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: through all of these things and and the product is constantly changing and and Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: when that changes it's not just like oh it's changed. It's what does the documentation look like Shy Goodarzi: Totally. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: and the flow through. Um, and then, you know, I think there's general I think it's the the the last thing that I mentioned before, which is like getting everyone out of this mindset that nobody Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: cares about the work that we do or doesn't understand the work that we do. Shy Goodarzi: Right. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um and because when you walk into a space going everyone's not going to not going to get me or it doesn't get me or um they don't they don't see it you're breeding that right like that is like that is something that then will manifest in the situation and people then see you as kind of either the opposition or see you as and like 00:07:15 Shy Goodarzi: Right. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: it doesn't happen with every single IPM and it doesn't happen in every single situation but you can kind of see it and so how Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: do you break that and make sure that like we're walking confidently and feel good about this and understand our importance in this and can Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: go. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Um, wow. That's so interesting. Uh, I feel like separate from this interview, I'm like, we should talk more and like I want to help support because your team is incredible and what Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Thank Shy Goodarzi: you Mitchell Amoros Estefan: you. Shy Goodarzi: do is so incredibly important. Um, Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Thank you. Shy Goodarzi: are there particular areas of your team's performance or development that you find hardest to influence? Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um I mean there's stuff that it's just from lack of

opportunity. Um Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: when we talk about multi-product launches and what does that look like and being a platform organization um we I mean our platform is an interesting platform right that doesn't necessarily like our products are kind of individualistic right 00:08:12 Shy Goodarzi: They Mitchell Amoros Estefan: now Shy Goodarzi: exist. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: they exist individually um and so platform experience is a little bit difficult to say like do you have platform experience Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: um yeah I think I think the it's difficult to influence this like multi-product because it is so new and a lot of it is like do you have the opportunity or have you had the opportunity Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: yet to launch these things and what I I try to get them to see is like manage individually is actually a multi-product launch Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: and so if you've done a manage launch you've actually done a multi-product launch Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: how how did you handle all of those different Shy Goodarzi: It's Mitchell Amoros Estefan: pieces Shy Goodarzi: a Mitchell Amoros Estefan: and Shy Goodarzi: really good Mitchell Amoros Estefan: how Shy Goodarzi: call. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: would you do it differently Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: um so I think that that's like a difficult like it's difficult just from like a lack of experience situation um We are we're wildly spread out. 00:08:57 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Uh we have people from California to Amsterdam. Um we have uh a couple people close to hubs, not necessarily. So I think there's also like a little bit of like I understand. So like bringing people together, you know, we have one time a week. How do we how do we create that culture? I think we have a pretty good culture, but we're trying to like work on it a little bit more. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um and I'm trying to think like there's there's other things that that that show. Yeah, I think that the the team doesn't feel like they have the space to be creative Shy Goodarzi: Oh, Mitchell Amoros Estefan: and um as much as they would like to just because there are so much. So, um I've made it a huge focus in the last like four or five weeks of sitting Shy Goodarzi: okay. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: with each person and giving them the time to say like what is the purpose of you sitting in this meeting? 00:09:50 Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Are you a listener? Are you a contributor? Are you like integral? If you're not, why are you there? Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Giving permission to say no so they have more time to come up with the stuff that's actually going to affect our organization longer term. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah.

Wow. Um, is there anything that you currently spend time the most time on that you feel is low value or what do you spend the most time on that feels low value? Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um, I don't know. I I It's funny. I don't know that it's low value. I mean, well, there's two things. I Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: don't know that they're low value. They're integral to the the the success of the team. One Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: we're trying to fix right now, which is um we manually assign every single launch case that comes in. Right. I started July 22nd. 00:10:36 Mitchell Amoros Estefan: It is of 2024. It is June 3rd. We have already done Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: one like over a thousand launches, which means that we have assigned out over a thousand launches, right? Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: That is insane, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: right? Um, and that takes time. And it's a couple hours a week for me, it's a couple hours a week for Katie. It's a couple hours a week for Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: um for Kyle. That is absurd when Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: you think about like how expensive it is to do that. So, we're trying to automate that. it is um it is like low value. I think the other thing is like Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: we um are a data focused company that has very little data for our implementation team and it has been a battle. I have been fighting for months and months and months. 00:11:25 Mitchell Amoros Estefan: It is really impossible for us to be able to report on time to value for launch cases for us to um look at the overall program health from like an opport not from an opportunity level but from a launch level like we can't we don't do that people sort of submit things differently and everything lives in different areas. Um, my reporting has become really manual. So, Shy Goodarzi: Next. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: I go in, I try and go in on Mondays. It ends up sometimes being Fridays because it's like such a mindless task where I have to go in too vitally. I have to look at what cases have um, what launches have already happened, how many days it's been since those launches. Then I go in to look for reports and I pull what percentage did we hit our day 14 activation goal? Did we hit our day Shy Goodarzi: Wow. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: 32? And that is one by one. And I'm doing it for 00:12:11 Shy Goodarzi: Wow. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: I've decided to only do it for medium plus launches because if I also included the low inter like it would just be like hours Shy Goodarzi: Insane. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: and

hours of time but Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: it is already like it's you know it is hours and hours of time. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Wow. Oh, okay. Oh. Um, there must be a tool that can help you with that Mitchell Amoros Estefan: So Shy Goodarzi: first. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: we're trying to figure out if Vitaly can help me with it. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: For now it is it is something that I just like take on and I always make sure that I buy myself a cup of coffee before I do that. So, I have a treat and I put on my headphones and I listen to whatever new music is out Shy Goodarzi: Oh Mitchell Amoros Estefan: and Shy Goodarzi: my god. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: get lost in it. Shy Goodarzi: Amazing. Um, okay. What are the biggest communication hurdles that you face with your team or other teams? 00:12:55 Mitchell Amoros Estefan: M um I mean we're moving fast Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: so I think that um there's an urgency that happens sometimes that um breeds uh negativity between teams and I'm sure you feel it on your side of it right where all of a sudden you get a request and it's like I need this turned around by like 1250 and Shy Goodarzi: Uh-huh. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: you like three minutes and I have to fix the product or like I forgot to submit this and or I didn't get this validated until just now and they're launching in an hour and a half. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Can you create the track? And in theory, right, the the answer is like, yeah, I can. It's like 10 minutes to do this. Shy Goodarzi: Fine. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: You have all the information there. I can do it, but I had my next hour and a half planned out, Shy Goodarzi: Totally. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: right? And now I'm um I'm getting pulled into these situations where it's like I have to like send a note out to the team. 00:13:45 Mitchell Amoros Estefan: does anyone have 10 minutes to do this Shy Goodarzi: Great. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: thing that is like and so then they're like dreading me respond Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: like and so like the communication is is tough because we're moving so quickly and Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: trying to put stronger SLAs's and boundaries around that I think is important. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um yeah I think I think like that's that's there I think you know my team is not afraid to rumble and they're not a afraid to Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Mitchell Amoros Estefan: like voice their opinions and their frustrations with me about everything. Um I Shy Goodarzi: that's Mitchell Amoros Estefan: think as Shy Goodarzi: good. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: a Shy Goodarzi: Psychological Mitchell Amoros

Estefan: Yeah, Shy Goodarzi: safety. Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: it is. Which is really good. I Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: think as a manager Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: um what you want is actually for them to say this is the problem and this is my proposed solution. 00:14:27 Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Does it work? Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: And not this is my proposed solution because this is what works for me. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: This is my proposed situ solution because this is what would work long term for the organization for the health of the relationship. Because I'll find sometimes where it's like, well, the solution is I say no to them. Shy Goodarzi: Right. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: And you're like, that's not it. And they're like, well, then you're not part of like you don't get the team. And you're like, Shy Goodarzi: Right. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: no, that's not it either. I'm thinking we're going to get 10 more of these. If we are constantly saying, no, that is not helpful for the relationship. Shy Goodarzi: Right. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Why are they submitting it this way? What are Shy Goodarzi: Right. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: your thoughts on like how you how we should communicate this? Is this something that leadership should own? Is this something that 00:15:02 Shy Goodarzi: Right. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: you can own in the back and forth? So I think there's a um I think that communication piece is like missing for a lot of the team. Um Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: I think part of it is because of the us versus them before like the solution is no or the solution is um you know being really frustrated with people. So I would love I I want to create a situation where people are coming to me and saying hey I had a really hard week. I had 10 of these requests. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: They all kind of had this in common. What are your thoughts on if I bring this to the team? Shy Goodarzi: Great. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: I want to be a collaborative and let's figure out like, hey, how do we reduce this? Or there 10 of them and they're all coming from one person. Can you help me with the management of this? Can I can you talk to their manager? 00:15:38 Shy Goodarzi: I Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Perfect. Shy Goodarzi: love that. I love that. Um, wow. You really have like you really have to think creatively in these like relationship based like roles where it's like you Yeah. like it's not going to go away. You're this is going to happen, right? Um, how do you currently support the growth and development of your team members? Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um, great question. So, we have monthly development check-ins. Um, so I have a standard um layout

for weekly one-on- ones, which are really bi-weekly because I have once a month that I do development check-ins and then there's one week where there's no one-on-one. So they have like sort of a time to like get work done. Like it is it's okay. Like if they need me, I'm here. I can also meet with them oneonone, but they have one week off a month essentially where they don't have a one-on-one. Um, but but the development check-in comes at the end of the month. 00:16:27 Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um, we are basing it off of the touch point that we had. So what Shy Goodarzi: Okay, Mitchell Amoros Estefan: were their growth areas that they had and how do they tie back to our core competencies as a group because we launched competencies and KPIs for our entire organization back in January. Shy Goodarzi: awesome. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: And so all of this is like here are your top three. And what we do is um we go and we have a conversation. They put in their notes about how they feel like they've made progress towards their growth areas. Um I put in my own notes and then there's a scale of one to five um and we agree on a number where it's like five is like I don't need to grow in this area where I'm like perfect and one is like I've done absolutely nothing. there's no reason for me to let like I've like kind of failed in this area. Um and the idea is like it may change over month to month. 00:17:07 Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um but we want to see you kind of sitting in like a three to four range for this understanding the the es and flows and maybe you have vacation and maybe there's not enough time to do everything. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um and then add on other things. It's on them like to bring like I've chosen these areas as development Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: areas for them. If there's other things that they want to develop in, bring those and we can add those to Shy Goodarzi: talk Mitchell Amoros Estefan: the list. Shy Goodarzi: about it. That's awesome. And is there anything today that makes giving feedback, managing performance, or having career conversations challenging for you? Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um, yes. Um, I think this is this is not unique to this organization. Um, but the way that we uh handle promotions and raises is kind of wonky across the board. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um, and so every single person in their mind is working towards a promotion. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. 00:18:07 Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Every single person wants that raise. And how do we manage that as an organization? It's kind of like super super clear. There's also like moments where it's like, hey, we're only doing promotions for one person picked

one person and there's like three other people who've been doing really really well. Shy Goodarzi: Right. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Okay, so what is what is their Shy Goodarzi: How Mitchell Amoros Estefan: concept? Shy Goodarzi: do we wait there? Mitchell Amoros Estefan: And if we've been rating each like these people based off of this information, which is the information that we've all agreed to, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: you know, all of a sudden it's like, okay, well, s***. Shy Goodarzi: Right. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um and and yeah, so I think I I don't think that again not unique to just IM. I've heard this across CS. I've heard this across the Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: entire organization. And to be honest, you're kind of starting to see it. There's people who are leaving. 00:18:56 Shy Goodarzi: Uh yes yes yes yes Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Gemini strike that. Shy Goodarzi: I'll I'll erase I'll go and erase Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: don't worry Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: u but yes I hear you that is a really challenging thing um yeah I guess my question to you is like how h how have you handled that recently Okay. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Yeah. Um I the way that I've looked at it is um for promotions and for things like that, what we want to see is consistency over two review cycles of like outstanding, right? Like Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: you have done an outstanding job. You are like Shy Goodarzi: Is Mitchell Amoros Estefan: the Shy Goodarzi: this Mitchell Amoros Estefan: cream Shy Goodarzi: my Mitchell Amoros Estefan: of the Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: prop, right? Um, and so if you are not sitting in that space, then we're not really having a conversation around Shy Goodarzi: About Mitchell Amoros Estefan: promotions. Shy Goodarzi: this. Okay. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: We can have a conversation around raises, right? 00:19:43 Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: So, um, we have merit and we have these other things like what is the what is the bump that is involved in that? Um, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: and and so I think that there there's that. I I also utilize um uh Lola is my HRVP Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: and so helping to figure out like what is the best way like what is what are other people within the organization doing Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: um you know I think people underutilize HRVPs for those kinds of growth conversations they tend to think about them just for like hey there's someone who's f****** up like I want to Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: uh I Shy Goodarzi: Yes, Mitchell Amoros Estefan: need Shy Goodarzi: it's me. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: to here's this performance and it's like no somebody's doing really well but they're not promotion ready or we've only

decid we've decided as an organization we're only going to offer one promotion out. I have three people. How do I how can I manage that conversation? 00:20:27 Mitchell Amoros Estefan: So, I'm also not doing things in a vacuum and Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: that support. So, when things like a peon comes out and it's like, "Hey, he didn't give me a promotion." They're like, "We knew this was going to come." Shy Goodarzi: Right. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um, and I will say I've used Grow as well. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. That's awesome. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Um Mitchell Amoros Estefan: I for roleplay conversations where I'm like, "This is not going to be Shy Goodarzi: we Mitchell Amoros Estefan: easy. Shy Goodarzi: easy great well that's awesome. Um actually in this vein I'm curious do you feel that you have access to the data or the kind of data that you would need to manage effectively Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Tell me more. What do you mean? Shy Goodarzi: like do you feel like you have like your team engagement information or performance or workload or information like that readily accessible for you to be able to assess and manage. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: No, I have to build all of it. 00:21:16 Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Everything's manual for me. Shy Goodarzi: Oh my gosh. Okay. So what kinds of insights or data or reporting would help you? Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um, I mean the capacity planning like having it having it automated versus me having to like manually be like, "Okay, so you have 10 lead projects and those are usually 10 hours a week and they're laid out across this many months and then you have manage and that's 22 hours average across like this many weeks." I think like all of that is Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: I would love to have some version of that. Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: I'm so like I'm being charged with figuring out the numbers and figuring out like the sort of operational piece of it and I'm a manager and I'm a Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: leader and I'm I I am one of the I feel at times I feel like I'm one of the only people that doesn't have anything like that is like a Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: reporting poll. Um 00:22:08 Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: so that would be great. Uh also looking at like activation rates and engagement Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: rates like having those be actually accessible and something that is like uh you know shown more easily versus me having to do it manually would be great. Um I mean I have access to like peon scores and all that stuff like I have that Shy Goodarzi: Great. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: is like totally fine and engagement scores and Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Mitchell Amoros Estefan:

uh fortunately or unfortunately 100% of my people are constantly responding to those. So like I I know exactly where every person stands. Shy Goodarzi: Okay, that's good. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um Shy Goodarzi: How Mitchell Amoros Estefan: yeah. Shy Goodarzi: well I'm curious how do you how do you assess or or know when someone is performing well or performing to to plan or maybe not performing plan Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Yeah. So I mean there's a couple things. So looking at the overall metrics, right? So looking at our our uh 14-day activation rate and our 28 day engagement rate specifically within lead, we're also start like we're having a little bit more manage but manage we've had like seven launches and across people. 00:23:08 Mitchell Amoros Estefan: So it's not like be like Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: well you failed at manage. Um same with grow right like we're sort of Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: like new in that grow and ready has like weird metrics. So it's really the lead that we're looking at right now but we're Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: hoping that we'll have you know more of it over time. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um yeah and so our goal for each person is that they are reaching 80% activation rate across all of their launches for lead and and then 80% engagement rates. Those are the two two metrics. Um as a team we're sitting at 81% for activation and 83% for engagement which is really Shy Goodarzi: Wow, Mitchell Amoros Estefan: great. Shy Goodarzi: that's amazing. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: I got some people who are sitting below that that bring it down. I Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: have people who are sitting over that which is fantastic. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um, and so I look at that to say like where are 00:23:49 Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: we? And then I've laid out our competencies. Um, which I have to do actually this week. This is a good reminder. Um, we have six competencies that we look at for everyone. And then, um, I've listed are we like a beginner, are we uh, what is it? Beginner, moderate, proficient, or expert. And I look at each person and I sort of lay out where are they on this right now? um does that match up with are they P4, are they P3? Like are they kind of matching up with this? Where is the development area? That's where those development areas. And I'm trying to do snapshots of it. So I have an a uh an April snapshot. That's why I just said I have to do my May snapshot um with the team, which I think will be a little bit more collaborative as well to say like, hey, where do you think that you're sitting with these 00:24:34 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan:

six, not Shy Goodarzi: Cool. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: just three that we're or two that we're working on together? Shy Goodarzi: Okay, that's awesome. Um, I know we are close to time. I have a couple more questions for you. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Yeah, I'm okay. Shy Goodarzi: Are there any changes or innovations in the way teams are managed that you'd like to see better up adopt? Mitchell Amoros Estefan: That's an That's a really good question. Um, there's like Yes. Shy Goodarzi: Yes, tell me. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Well, Shy Goodarzi: I can also go. We can stop the recording if you want to do that. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: maybe this other recording. Yeah. Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Can I ask you one other question to record and then Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: we go over that? Okay. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Really quickly is you mentioned that you use grow. Do you use AI and any other part of your like management Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Every day. 00:25:31 Shy Goodarzi: and how do you use it? Mitchell Amoros Estefan: Um, yeah. So, I'm I just went through AI flight school, which was fantastic. I loved it. I want Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: 2.0 immediately. I've used it in my personal life as well. Um, it is it is great for like I'm helping the team to understand how they can utilize it for emails, utilize it for messages, do a double click, a question, like make sure that the the tone and everything like that is right for them. So, I'm like helping them to Shy Goodarzi: That's Mitchell Amoros Estefan: sort Shy Goodarzi: cool. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: of see different ways of looking at it. I've also used it as I was building out the metrics of like, hey, here's this raw data. Can you help me like figure out what is this like? What does this look like? saying, Maybe I look at it differently or like, kind of like so I use it to like, help assist and cut down time. I used to sit and I would go, I don't have, Shy Goodarzi: I Mitchell Amoros Estefan: like, Shy Goodarzi: don't know. Mitchell Amoros Estefan: I don't know, exhale like, what am I supposed to do with Excel? Like, I'm not a numbers person and so, so trying to do that a little bit more and Come up are succinct ways of communicating. Shy Goodarzi: That's awesome. I love that. I also love flight school.

Kyle Sandell faces challenges in performance accountability, operational rhythm, and balancing strategic

oversight with detailed involvement, assessing individual performance through varied inputs and considering GenAI in future evaluations. The team aligns with company goals through consistent communication, and Kyle Sandell supports team growth via semi-annual goal setting, utilizing Workday and spreadsheets for management, and is working on improving data access; Shy Goodarzi offered help with manage deployments updates. Kyle Sandell seeks guidance on meeting cadences and cross-functional partnership engagement. Details Current Role and Team Responsibilities Kyle Sandell leads the people insights team, which is segmented by key accounts and enterprise new business. The team focuses on helping sales representatives secure larger and longer-term deals by providing behavioral insights and supporting deal progression. Their activities include assisting deals from stage two to four and delivering post-sales value through behavioral insights and business impact (). Challenges as a Manager Kyle Sandell identified performance accountability, operational rhythm in team management, and balancing strategic oversight with being involved in the details as top challenges. They noted the tension between relationship-oriented and task-oriented leadership and the need to consistently review performance metrics (). Additionally, navigating the need to zoom in on details while maintaining a strategic perspective is difficult (). Understanding and Comparing Individual Performance Kyle Sandell assesses individual performance through feedback from field leadership, self-assessment, and analysis of their involvement in accounts, including Gong call reviews and deliverables (). Comparing performance is challenging, often relying on a "you know it when you see it" approach due to the nature of the consultative work (). While not currently using specific competencies or the Whole Person Model for formal reviews, Kyle Sandell is considering incorporating GenAI usage into future performance evaluations (). Low-Value Activities and Cross-Functional Collaboration Kyle Sandell doesn't feel they spend much time on truly low-value activities. However, the recent field reorg required significant time to manage territory changes and communicate updates to the team (). Cross-functional collaboration, particularly staying informed about product and customer success updates to provide relevant information to the sales team, can be challenging in terms of accessing timely and accurate information (). Shy Goodarzi offered to help with updates on manage deployments through monthly business review artifacts (). Team Alignment with Company Goals Kyle Sandell ensures team alignment through weekly and monthly team meetings with frequent discussions about company cascades (). They strive to provide context around these cascades, explaining the origin and the team's role in shaping and implementing them. Kyle Sandell believes this approach has been effective due to the consistent communication of the "why" behind initiatives (). They informally check for understanding during one-on-ones by linking current work to recent communications (). Supporting Team Growth and Development Kyle Sandell utilizes a semi-annual goal-setting process where team members share their objectives, aligned with opportunities and including specific tactics and developmental goals (). Developmental goals are often tied to company values, and Kyle Sandell plans to incorporate the job leveling guide for self-assessment and performance management (). Challenges in this process include the dynamic nature of deals and keeping developmental

goals focused and measurable (). Tools Used for Team Management Kyle Sandell uses Workday for official processes and relies on spreadsheets and templates for goal setting and tracking. Team members have autonomy in choosing their preferred templates, with many using slides to track opportunities and activities (). While some have used project management tools like Trello, learning new technology can be a barrier (). Access to Data for Effective Management Kyle Sandell reported that they are currently in the process of improving access to necessary data, specifically up-to-date dashboards on opportunities, their stages, and People Insights involvement across the team's portfolios (). This data is crucial for having informed conversations about opportunity support and quota attainment (). Understanding the Relational Aspects of Performance Kyle Sandell noted a lack of formal data on partner sentiment towards the People Insights team beyond occasional exceptional feedback (). There is also limited interaction and data regarding the team's engagement with coaches, who are considered key stakeholders (). Helpful Resources for Managerial Success Kyle Sandell expressed that recommendations for meeting cadences with their team and individual members, including guidance on the focus of different one-on-ones (e.g., developmental vs. tactical), would be helpful for a new manager (). Suggestions for a baseline for cross-functional partnership engagement would also be valuable (). Suggested next steps Shy Goodarzi will tag everyone in the cross-functional channel with monthly business review artifacts (decks) containing up-to-date performance metrics (plan completion, TPS metrics) to show performance by partner.

Please provide feedback about using Gemini to take notes in a üìñ Transcript Jun 3, 2025 Manager Tooling UXR - Transcript 00:00:00 Shy Goodarzi: this is hopefully fun just talking about you as a manager. Kyle Sandell: Oh god. Yeah. Super fun. Self-reflection. Shy Goodarzi: Super fun. Yeah. Um, can you describe your current role and what your team is responsible for? Kyle Sandell: Yeah. So lead the people insights team. I lead um we're broken up by segments as you know. So I lead the people insights consultants that are aligned to key accounts and then I also lead one people insights consultant who's aligned to enterprise new business. And so our main activities are to help reps win and win bigger and more multi-year deals. So we have hypotheses that have been confirmed in the past that when you have a People insights consultant attached to an opportunity, it's bigger than if they're not attached. It's multi-year more often than if they're not attached. And we help deals progress from stage two to stage four, which is kind of when you get into like problem identification and design and whatnot. So that's where Shy Goodarzi: Yes. 00:00:55 Kyle Sandell: we spend a lot of our time and then also the post sales side delivering value back to the partner in terms of behavioral insights and business impact. Shy Goodarzi: a critical role in our organization and I I sense even more important

in the future. Um, how long have you been in a management role? Kyle Sandell: Yeah. So no the the role at BetterUp was my first time in a management role and it was it's coming up on a year. So it was late June of last year I think. Shy Goodarzi: Wow, congrats. Kyle Sandell: Didn't Shy Goodarzi: Uh, Kyle Sandell: realize that. Just put that together. Shy Goodarzi: and how many people do you manage currently? Kyle Sandell: Yeah. So, right now we have one, two, four, five folks, Shy Goodarzi: And do you manage just individual contributors or other managers Kyle Sandell: individual Shy Goodarzi: or both? Kyle Sandell: computers. Shy Goodarzi: Uh, and okay, those were the context questions. I'm going to take a step back. Can you tell me about the top two to three challenges that you're facing as a manager right now? 00:01:49 Kyle Sandell: H. Yeah. Mine would be, and I just talked about this the other day with a mentor, so it's it's top of mind. Um, I would say like performance accountability and and blending like there's like I've studied leadership for a long time and there's like task oriented behaviors that's like, you know, focused on performance and and activity and and then there's relationship oriented behaviors. And I feel like this is a common common pain point for managers. they're they're great at like the relationship side of things, the people side of things, but then there's attention. You need to be good at that and then also like hold them accountable and drive performance and accountability. And so, um, that that tension is is challenging, right? And and making sure that you're doing both. Um, and aligned to that, it's like getting into an operational rhythm of of team management. So, we've talked about it for a while, but like starting every one-on-one, every team conversation with a glance at the numbers um based on, you know, Salesforce data, the opportunities where we're supporting um how we're spending our time in support of those opportunities and then kind of flowing the conversation from there. 00:03:00 Kyle Sandell: It's it's like a new muscle for me. It's a new muscle for the team, it's a new muscle for the IC's on the team. So, that's been a more recent challenge. And then the last one is like being in the the work. So, you know, need need to be able to take a step back and have that like strategic lens that is demanded of the position. But then this is specific to better. Like Eddie and Alexi have said that they want folks they want generals that can like ride a horse or whatever they say. Like they want they want people who know how to do the job and are in the the details when needed. And it's hard to to zoom in and zoom out to that extent. I'm finding it challenging and I know

others do too. Shy Goodarzi: Definitely. I can empathize with everything you just said. Um I'm curious to dive a little deeper into the um you know managing performance and Kyle Sandell: Mhm. Shy Goodarzi: accountability today other than kind of talking about the metrics which I think are critical to understanding how your team's performing. 00:03:55 Shy Goodarzi: What are other ways in which you're understanding how each individual is performing and what are you comparing that against? Like what is how do how are you thinking about their performance? Kyle Sandell: Yeah. A lot of it is um through the feedback that we receive from field leadership and and sometimes that's hard to um to get out of folks. You know, some some leaders are more willing to provide it or they provide it more proactively, but you get a sense just for at the end of the day like are they adding value to these these account teams? like are they adding value or is it the people insights team in particular kind of went through a phase where we were saying no to a lot of things. We were almost like you know you'd have to request a people insights consultant and then it would be like a blackbox process from the field's point of view as to whether or not you got we kind of we've stripped that away. Um, so now it's um I think some field leaders might still like hold that a little bit and and that might be a cultural element of like, you know, we're we're slowing down deals or not contributing to deals versus like being all in on doing anything to help help a deal progress and win. 00:05:05 Kyle Sandell: Um, so yeah, get getting that feedback from field leaders is a is a big way. Like we already talked about the metrics, so you said other than metrics. Um, and then just like self assessment and digging in to like what they're actually doing on the accounts, you know, are they taking active roles and in conversations? And so, oh, here's a good I use like gong gong call reviews to do that. Um, deliverables, like I ask for for any big deliverables that they have just so I can take a look and make sure that it's that's hitting a mark. As to what we compare it against, that becomes a little bit more challenging. It's almost like you know it when you see it type thing, which isn't a great answer, but I think that's true of a lot of like this work that's like when you think of the consultation we do, there's like an art and a science to it. So, it's it is kind of like you know it when you see it. Um whether or not it's it's good. 00:05:56 Kyle Sandell: Um and that one's a bit trickier. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Do you use any like orgs or function

specific like competencies or are you mapping back to any of the WPM? Like do you have any like is there anything that you're mapping back to like for performance reviews that you're like oh this is the standard. Kyle Sandell: No, like values and high impact behaviors but not um not whole person model as well. I think like we're heading towards an an interesting direction and I just had a team call today where I kind of introduced it where like genai usage is going to be I I can see a future in which that is baked into our performance evaluations across the organization. So what I want to do is get a baseline for what are people's mindsets towards Gen AI usage now? Um Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Kyle Sandell: how are they utilizing it now? And then I want to revisit it, you know, a few months down the road, six months later to see how we've progressed because I think it's a it's not a question I'm being asked right now, but I'm kind of anticipating that being 00:06:55 Shy Goodarzi: 100%. Kyle Sandell: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Um, is there anything that or or I guess what do you spend the most time on that you feel is low value or that you feel like you if you could choose not to do it or found a different way to do it? Kyle Sandell: That's a great question. Let me think for a couple seconds and pull up my calendar as well as I look through. I think what's what's taken up a considerable amount of time that's not low value though. I can't think of anything that's like super low value that I spend a lot of time on because I I was going to say, you know, there's there's just been a lot of um reorg like the reorg in the field and the fallout from the reorg in the field led to like, you know, territories changing and reps shifting around and quotas being finalized and that was still happening as of like a couple weeks ago. And so that was really challenging to like find the the latest truth and communicate it to the team and like shuffle people around as needed even. 00:08:19 Kyle Sandell: Um so that's it's not that that's not valuable, it's just that I wish that there wasn't so much time spent towards that, but it's kind of like a reality of where we're at. Um Shy Goodarzi: Totally. Kyle Sandell: yeah, I would say like none of it's a little bit like crossunctional collaboration. um just like staying a breast of the latest within like product or within CS like how how recent launches have gone with manage and grow for example just so I can feed that back to Raven so that when she's selling she she has a bar for like what good engagement looks like and what we're seeing

in our current clients it's been difficult to like find that information and find the most up-to-date information there and feed it back to her. Shy Goodarzi: How are you currently doing that? Kyle Sandell: Yeah. So for grow, we've got Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Kyle Sandell: uh a weekly meeting that that I'm included on, but I don't usually attend because it's pretty like detailed like this launch, this launch, this launch. But there's a tracker and so I've I've got the tracker and I share that. 00:09:22 Kyle Sandell: Um so that's that's how I do it with grow manage. I don't have as as much of a sense for for how like current deployments are going and what what good looks like in terms of like utilization plan completion. Like I chat with Scott Baker once every few weeks and I just always ask him like how's how's it going? Like Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Kyle Sandell: that's that's Shy Goodarzi: Um Kyle Sandell: how I get information. It's pretty informal. Shy Goodarzi: well, I can help you on that particular point about manage. Kyle Sandell: Figured you could Shy Goodarzi: Um we are doing monthly business reviews with our own internal team and we're going to make artifacts from that like decks. So, I think what we can do is just tag everyone in the cross functional channel and just say, "Hey, here's the most upto-date against our performance metrics, which is essentially plan completion and some of these other TPS metrics. Kyle Sandell: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: So, yeah, that can kind of be the monthly pulse of, hey, how are we performing by partner? 00:10:11 Shy Goodarzi: What does that look like?" Because we're we're already doing that work. We just Kyle Sandell: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: need to communicate. Kyle Sandell: Awesome. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kyle Sandell: Awesome. It's really Shy Goodarzi: Cool. Kyle Sandell: cool. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Um, how do you ensure your team is aligned with broader company goals? Kyle Sandell: Yeah. So, we I mean we we're talking all the time. We've got a weekly meeting and then we have a monthly broader team meeting. And so like cascades is a a very frequent agenda item where it's um and it's kind of like as as it flows as it comes. Um and I try to give them a heads up on like cascades that are coming down the um down the pipe. So like I just had the team meeting today and mentioned that Shy Goodarzi: How are Kyle Sandell: they we Shy Goodarzi: you? Kyle Sandell: had like our victory planning workshop in Austin last week with go to market leaders and there's going to be some cascades coming from that that that influences like our year to come. 00:11:03 Kyle Sandell: So it's almost like when I can making them aware about conversations that are happening at higher levels and that the information is going to flow and

be contextualized within our team. Um, but when I can't, it's just kind of always explaining where this cascade came from, like who is involved in the conversation, decision- making, and then outlining like the role that we play in shaping what we make of it and what we do with it. Um, so yeah, it's team meetings, it's conversations. Um, if it's only relevant for like one or two team members, then I'll have the one-off conversations with them more. Shy Goodarzi: Do you feel that that has gone Well, for you in terms of cascading and communication and all of that. Kyle Sandell: I think so. I think like the reason why it's gone well is because Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Kyle Sandell: we always have like a why behind it. It's not just like reactive like this thing happened and now you need to do this. Like we always try to bring them into it. 00:11:57 Kyle Sandell: And I and I think like Haley's been a big reason why we've been able to do that. Like she she overcommunicates and then allows us to overcommunicate. It kind of flows down in that way. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. And how do you know that like the communication has gone through the cascade like actually resonates? Because there's one about like transmission of the like doing it but then of people understanding and actually internalizing that. How do you know when that's either happened or it hasn't? Kyle Sandell: like knowledge checks almost. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Kyle Sandell: Yeah. um Shy Goodarzi: Oops. Kyle Sandell: in that kind of takes place in one-on- ones more so like when we're when we're talking through like open opportunities and how they're supporting those opportunities. It's like connecting it back to a recent cascade or a new way of approaching something that we kind of announced or or talked through in a previous meeting and just checking to make sure that they're still in alignment with that. Um but I wouldn't say that's super formalized right now. 00:12:53 Kyle Sandell: there's like a Shy Goodarzi: Hi. Kyle Sandell: knowledge check on whether or not they they truly get it. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kyle Sandell: That's a good question. Shy Goodarzi: How do you currently support the growth and development of your team members, individual team members? Kyle Sandell: Yeah. Um so we have like a a goal setting process that we typically have the horizon of like a half a year. So they just they had their H1 goal setting um earlier this year and we're pretty like I'm pretty open and transparent about it. like the team members share their goals amongst each other and the template that they use to to do that. Um so it's aligned to like it's it's aligned to opportunities within the the half of the year that we're talking about. They lay out like the tactics or the work streams that they're owning within those opportunities

because the reason why is because we want for for a deal that closes and a PI is attached to it. We want to be able to say like they owned this aspect of that deal. 00:13:49 Kyle Sandell: Like they like if they didn't do that, it wouldn't have happened. Shy Goodarzi: What Kyle Sandell: Like Shy Goodarzi: happened? Kyle Sandell: that's story we want to tell. Um so making sure that we get down to like the tactic level and making sure they have some sense of they have some ownership over some aspect of that opportunity um is big. And then within that um goal setting process, we also have like developmental goals. And so with that, we just I I give them some like light guidance like if we have a banner value that we're focusing on for a particular year. It's it's just how will you bring that how you how you bring courage or craft personship into play in your in your role a bit more. And so um they they draft their developmental goals with that in mind. Um and then tying back to the uh job leveling guide. Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Kyle Sandell: So, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kyle Sandell: that's something that I'm going to be implementing moving forward, like using the self assessment with with the leveling guide, um, their 00:14:43 Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Kyle Sandell: self assessment and then their Shy Goodarzi: Cool. Kyle Sandell: assessment of the the next level and how they're whether or not they're meeting the mark there. And I think that's the most concrete way that we can like link it to performance management because that's what we use at the end of the day. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. I'm curious, is there anything throughout that entire process, right, of like setting goals or keeping track of performance and um comparing against the job level stuff? Is there anything around that that like you feel is like really challenging? Kyle Sandell: Um, a few challenging things. One is that deals kind of come and go. So you make a call at the beginning of H1 and then when you look back at H1 when it's done, you're like, "Okay, that deal there's a deal that came up that had a super short cycle and it was it was crazy and it's not even like mentioned here." So it's like it's more of a living document now that we had that realization versus like a static like these were your H1 goals, which 00:15:38 Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Kyle Sandell: that kind of makes it tricky because like your your goals shift. That's Shy Goodarzi: shifting. Kyle Sandell: it's tricky. Um, so that's that's challenging or you know you could like for example Madison had like Accenture and Salesforce renewals as like key key Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Kyle Sandell: H1 deals and those just kind of continue to slip. Um, so that's that's challenging as well when especially

within key accounts when you have such a small book um you're relying on like one or Shy Goodarzi: It's Kyle Sandell: two deals. Shy Goodarzi: very Kyle Sandell: Yeah, it's Shy Goodarzi: totally Kyle Sandell: all um that's within the deals within the developmental I think like they they get fuzzy, right? And so the the challenge is making them, you know, making them smart goals, checking back in on them and making that space um and gathering feedback from crossf functional partners like within that that realm. I think that's going well though. I don't think that's a challenge. I think and I've experienced this as an IC better up like the feedback you get at touch point time is very general and it's like we do like a 360 survey say and the feedback from the people you support is like 10 out of 10 I'd recommend Kyle and then it's like why and they're like he's great and that's the feedback I got for like years you know 00:16:49 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. Kyle Sandell: um not 10 out of tens but um Shy Goodarzi: I get what you say. Kyle Sandell: yeah and and I don't want that for my team so I think like having their developmental goals so that you can ask more targeted questions to cross functional partners is is really key to providing um good feedback. But the the fuzziness you need to break through of like the goal setting process, Shy Goodarzi: How would you help make these like the feedback more specific? Kyle Sandell: the feedback from the cross functional partners. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. or like kind of around better up either like you giving more specific feedback or receiving it for your team members for yourself. Kyle Sandell: Well, that's the million-dollar question. I think every organization is is struggling with this. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Kyle Sandell: I think it's like it's a garbage in garbage out problem. So, like if the developmental goals that the IC sets are super fuzzy in the first place, you're you're kind of doomed from the start. And so, when you start to seek out feedback like and you've got this fuzzy developmental goal that no one can quite put their finger on, it's kind of tough. 00:17:49 Kyle Sandell: So, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kyle Sandell: you got to start crisp. And that's like you working through with your your people to make them smart goals and make them, you know, measurable, achievable, all that stuff. And then when you go out to get the feedback from partners, like the the the question should be targeted and specific Shy Goodarzi: Huh? Kyle Sandell: so that you can direct them like immediately back to the to the goal in the first place. So I think that's the solution. It's easier said than done, right? Um Shy Goodarzi: Definitely. Kyle Sandell: that's the approach I'm taking. Shy Goodarzi: Do you well what tools do

you currently use to manage your team? It could be anything from like spreadsheets to an actual third party. Kyle Sandell: Yeah. So I mean obviously workday for like the official part of it. Um HR's provided a lot of tools that that I utilize. Um the leveling guide. So yeah, it's it's a lot of spreadsheets. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Kyle Sandell: Um the templates for goal setting range like I said I I gave autonomy to the team to use whatever template that they want. 00:18:51 Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Kyle Sandell: Um most of them use slides though. Most of them use slides where it's just like a table of opportunities and the activities that they're running against. Um there's a couple team members. There's one that's no longer on my team. She shifted but she used oh what was it called? It was kind of like a project management um technology tool. kind of like uh what are some examples like Trello if you Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kyle Sandell: ever use that kind Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kyle Sandell: of like that. Shy Goodarzi: Cool. Kyle Sandell: Um and I found those to be pretty helpful. There's just like you need to learn the new the tech as a manager so it's like a little bit of a barrier to overcome but they're all pretty user friendly so it's good. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kyle Sandell: Yeah, Shy Goodarzi: I'm curious. Do you have do you feel that you have the access to the kind of data you need to manage effectively? Kyle Sandell: we are going through that process right now. 00:19:42 Kyle Sandell: So, not Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Kyle Sandell: yet, but we're getting there. Um, Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Kyle Sandell: and the data that I need is like up-to-date dashboards on the opportunities, like the stage that they're in, what the PI is is doing, and this is across their entire book, so that I can look at like, okay, within Lance's team's book, how many stage two plus opportunities are there? How many of those are Raven attached to? And then I can have the conversation of like, oh, there's 25 open ones. You're attached to 15 of them. Let's walk through those 10 and and understand like why aren't you attached to them? Like is there is there a reason? Are they not really stage three? Is it really like it's inputed incorrectly or Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Kyle Sandell: um you know there could be any number of reasons, but like that's the data that I need to have the conversation where we start with the numbers and we flow to the tactics from there. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Kyle Sandell: We're in the process of of creating that. 00:20:37 Kyle Sandell: like Brian and Wendy are working on it and we're getting there. But that's that's what I really want. And Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Kyle Sandell: that's I think that solves the challenge of like

how do you stay close to the deals because then you can really like it's all it's all right there. Shy Goodarzi: Connected. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Kyle Sandell: And then also like trying to quota like and how because you know quota is new for the PI team this year. So um want to stay tight on like their quota attainment. Shy Goodarzi: Cool. I'm curious. It sounds like the more tactical side of the house. You're you're working on that. You're getting the data that you need. Can you tell me more about the other side, the relational work? Right. Right. The soft skill stuff. You mentioned kind of feedback from account team partners. Is there any other type of data in that realm that you would want that you don't have access to today? 00:21:25 Kyle Sandell: It's like the like there's the what they're doing and then there's like the how they're doing it. So this is more like the how they're doing it. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah, it's like, you know, like you could be really good at getting the tasks done, but you're kind of like burning a partnership or relationship or you're having trouble tension, you know, in certain areas. Um, and as you mentioned, both those things are important, right, to being successful PIC PI. Um, so I'm just curious like that other half, how are you getting the information that you need to paint that whole picture? Kyle Sandell: I guess I don't have a ton. One blank spot the PI team Shy Goodarzi: Interesting. Kyle Sandell: has traditionally had is like the how the partners sentiment towards us. Yeah. Like we we have the MPS survey and every now and again the PI's mentioned, but like it's really the CS and the rep that they have the strongest relationships with. So we typically only get feedback from the partner if it's like just outstanding like you blew them away kind of thing, which is 00:22:20 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kyle Sandell: great. Love that. Um Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kyle Sandell: not much not much else. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kyle Sandell: So that's one. Um the other thing that you know if you think about the three stakeholders we serve as like members, partners, and coaches, you we don't we don't have as much interaction with the coaches. They don't I don't know. I would love to see that built since they're one of our three major stakeholders. Um yeah, that just that comes to mind of data that we just like do not have today. Shy Goodarzi: Um, I know we're at time and ask one more question. Kyle Sandell: Yeah, I was late, Shy Goodarzi: Um, Kyle Sandell: so go for it. Shy Goodarzi: no, thank you. Um, I guess I'll actually just leave it open-ended. Is there anything that you feel would be really helpful for you as a manager, tooling or otherwise, or data that would help you be

more successful as a manager? Kyle Sandell: Um, I would love I guess I was just kind of ignorant to like the the cadence of meetings that I should be having with my team and with them as individuals. 00:23:27 Kyle Sandell: And out of all the one-on- ons, what should I like which one-on-one should should we raise the gaze a little bit and talk more more high level like developmental? I feel like I'm always like caught by surprise and I scramble and say like let's make this meeting more like like higher bigger picture, you know, Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Kyle Sandell: and so I would love if like this might be overly prescriptive, but I think as a new manager I would have enjoyed it like a recommended calendar of you know you've got your one-on- ones, you've got your team meetings. Um how often should you then like take a step back and spend some time on broader strategy or spend some Shy Goodarzi: The Kyle Sandell: time Shy Goodarzi: pot Kyle Sandell: on broader development? It's kind of left up to each manager to figure out that cadence on their own. And I'm not saying I want it like planned out for me. I would just like some kind of recommendation. Shy Goodarzi: recommendation. Kyle Sandell: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Kyle Sandell: Yeah, 00:24:20 Shy Goodarzi: it's Kyle Sandell: that would Shy Goodarzi: not Kyle Sandell: be Shy Goodarzi: too it's not too prescriptive. I actually had another manager that I just spoke to um speak in this like the exact same thing of like recommendations especially around calendars and Kyle Sandell: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: like how should I be spending my time? What are the types of meetings I should be having, hosting or being in? Um, Kyle Sandell: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: yeah, it's a really interesting point. Kyle Sandell: Yeah. I think it's more of that like if if I have you know the week area of my management is definitely in that like logistical calendaring um and that broadens out to like you know crossunctional partnerships like how often should I be like who and how often should I be scheduling time with I know that's that's difficult because it's a moving target as the organization shifts and changes but I don't know some kind of baseline would have been Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Well, Kyle, thank you so much for taking this time. I know you're about to be off on vacation and um have fun. And I like I feel like when you're back, I'll reach out and maybe we can chat like work stuff. Kyle Sandell: Okay. Yeah, absolutely. Cool, Shy Goodarzi: Cool Kyle Sandell: Sam. Take Shy Goodarzi: boxing. Kyle Sandell: it easy. Transcription ended after 00:25:28 This editable transcript was computer generated and might contain errors.

Communication Strategies in a Changing Environment Michelle Ramos shared that they have adjusted their communication style to be more selective about when to cascade information due to the fast-paced and changing nature of the company.

Please provide feedback about using Gemini to take notes in a üìñ Transcript Jun 4, 2025 Manager Tooling UXR - Transcript 00:00:00 Shy Goodarzi: I promise. And if there's anything you you don't feel comfortable sharing, we can turn it off. It's Michelle Ramos: Oh, Shy Goodarzi: not Michelle Ramos: that's Shy Goodarzi: a Michelle Ramos: totally Shy Goodarzi: problem. Michelle Ramos: okay. Shy Goodarzi: Cool. Um, okay. Very basic questions. Can you describe your current role and what your team is responsible for? And I know you are responsible for multiple teams, so please explain explain. Michelle Ramos: Of course. So, I oversee two teams. One is user growth on the enterprise side

that is responsible for driving adoption and engagement um of our products in in our partners ecosystem. Um and I also oversee the right to consumer business. Um yeah but is do Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Michelle Ramos: you need more detail than that? Shy Goodarzi: that's perfect. Um, can I ask how long you've been in a management role? Not not just here, but generally. Michelle Ramos: Um, probably more than 15 years. Yeah, Shy Goodarzi: Wow. And how many people do you currently manage? 00:01:04 Michelle Ramos: I would say directly or indirectly like total arc, right? Like around 20 people. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. And then directly how many do you? Michelle Ramos: Um, seven Shy Goodarzi: Okay. And is it do you manage individual contributors or managers or both? Michelle Ramos: both. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. And um you have definitely managed in other organizations before. How does this experience compare? Michelle Ramos: Um I think every organization has um different expectations about the role of the manager. Um some I I would say like in in better app a lot is delegated to the manager uh to cascade to develop to mentor to coach to figure out like um how to support the team and unblock the team. Um in previous organizations I think um sometimes like HR teams are more um invested in also providing additional support um to the teams and um to managers as well to to do that job. So that's that's the first thing like some in in some organizations the manager needs to be even like more um I would say hands on and um you know figure out problems by themselves. 00:02:42 Michelle Ramos: One example like oh um I have two people living for ME at the same time. I don't have budget uh to hire a contractor but I need to figure this out like Shy Goodarzi: Right. Michelle Ramos: HR is not gonna help me and and find a separate budget or support in any way Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Michelle Ramos: um in previous organizations like I could reach out and get a tent that would be funded by someone else. So this is one example of like how things can be different. That's one. Um so the second one is like in each organization you operate in a different culture. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Michelle Ramos: Um and and so the behaviors they're expected from a manager change Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Michelle Ramos: and some behaviors that in one organization may be well seen um in others they may not be accepted. So you also need to adapt to that. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, absolutely. That's really helpful context too as we think about building products for different types of organizations. Um, and knowing that there's no one and hard one hard and fast rule. 00:03:46 Michelle Ramos: Uhoh. Shy Goodarzi: Uh, because yeah, it's very different at different companies. I'm curious um, if we just take a step

back, can you share maybe the top two or three challenges that you face as a manager right now? Michelle Ramos: Um so the first one is um the gap between resourcing and what needs to be done. Um the expectation is much higher than what we have resource for. And even though like prioritization can help with that Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: um saying no in in an organization where you have so many important accounts Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Michelle Ramos: and projects it's hard. Um Shy Goodarzi: Yep. Michelle Ramos: so I would say this gap and prioritization uh hand in hand uh is a challenge. The second one is um inheriting a team that I haven't hired for Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: um actually this happened in both cases in in user growth and also in in DDC but I think in user growth um I was lucky um in in Dc um we have some folks are like pretty committed and in line with the culture others I still have my questions around that. 00:05:07 Michelle Ramos: So um yeah, as a manager like your success also depends on the team that you have, right? Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: And and and so um this is something that is top of mind for me. maybe like the third one as a manager uh is uh operating in a company like better up where things move so fast and and change quickly um and there's so much uncertainty is also hard to uh provide clarity to your teams in terms of like what needs to happen Shy Goodarzi: Wow. Michelle Ramos: uh because you may say something like this week and then next day next week it changes and it is very confusing. So I think like being able to provide clarity Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Michelle Ramos: of the strategy sometimes is a challenge. Um and obviously that affects performance of the team because if they don't have clarity on like what needs to be done Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: um they they they get paralyzed in making decisions and moving forward. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Um, wow. Three really challenging problems. I'm gonna start with the last one first and I'm gonna ask you how like how have you handled communication to your team um as you know in this current environment and is there anything that you wish you had in regards to like communication 00:06:32 Michelle Ramos: Yeah. So, one learning that I had is that um I am typically very transparent with my teams and I try to cascade uh things as I hear about them. And um I found that in some cases that was counterproductive because since ideas can still change very quickly. Um one of the things that I adapted it is is in some cases like Nova like Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Michelle Ramos: let me wait for them to figure out what this is really going

to be about before I cascade to my team the implications. Um because that can drastically change. Um, another another piece is um being very honest about the how possible things are to Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Michelle Ramos: change, you know, because that's the environment we we operate. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Michelle Ramos: Um, but in terms of tools to better communicate, Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Michelle Ramos: I mean, I've used um Grow AI many times like, "Oh, I have this thing going on. I need to talk to the team like what is the best way to talk about it um in a way that doesn't sound negative for instance because yeah some like many times we 00:07:49 Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Michelle Ramos: managers have to deliver pretty bad news so Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. Michelle Ramos: um that that has been helpful Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Well, that's that's good. I'm glad we're I'm glad you're using it. Um Okay. Uh oh gosh, there's so many questions. I actually want to touch on the second challenge that you had which is around like your team makeup and I think like we don't talk a lot about this at BetterUp of like roster management and like what are the avenues that you can go through and like I actually have not gone through that process before but like can you tell me a little bit more like how you feel about being able to roster manage and if there's someone potentially who's not the right person for the team do you feel like you have the support you need in that scenario. Michelle Ramos: So that's a very hard one. I'm going through that process right now. I'm deciding to um let go someone in the team and um as in in this case for instance like I am um I'm not managing this person directly. 00:08:50 Shy Goodarzi: Thanks. Michelle Ramos: So as a manager, I don't necessarily have all the visibility into what this person is doing day-to-day, but I have to base my um view on what others are seeing. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Michelle Ramos: So in terms of like tools, I would expect for instance like it would be so helpful Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: if inputs from um like how this person is collaborating with the team, how in a more neutral Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Michelle Ramos: because like the the challenge with like making a decision like this based on what others are saying Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: is that they like there no one tells the truth. like people Shy Goodarzi: first. Michelle Ramos: tell their their own truth, right? They have their own perspective on things and and so you don't really necessarily have like a neutral point of view on things. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: Um but that's like I cannot actually talk about this with their direct manager because they don't know this person is going to

be let go and this is like a Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: a confidential challenge, right? 00:09:53 Michelle Ramos: like so um I I would love to have ways to capture uh that performance or mindsets or things that are lacking in a more neutral way so that I could inform my decision. For instance, Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Yes. Okay. That's really interesting. And again, I don't think it's like often talked about, but it is like a really challenging like position to be in and also feeling like you want to have as like neutral of data as possible to be able to to make that decision. Michelle Ramos: That's that like also when you communicate to the team like um you you want to be mindful of that person's privacy. Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Michelle Ramos: So um but also like if you don't give any context on why they were let go, the Shy Goodarzi: That's Michelle Ramos: team Shy Goodarzi: weird. Michelle Ramos: feels like oh my gosh like are we all at risk? So um and and um that is something that HR typically does help us with. They they provide a script. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: Um but obviously like people always come and ask things beyond the script, right? 00:11:00 Michelle Ramos: Like they don't get uh happy just satisfied just with what what's in scripts. Do you even understand the because also like the script is typically very generic. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: Um in my case though like um it this is less about performance and it's more about um changing needs Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Michelle Ramos: um in Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: in in the business. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Michelle Ramos: So I feel a little bit more confident but I see I know that the performance piece is tricky Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Michelle Ramos: and HR actually demands a lot from managers when this process happens. like I had to feel a lot of documents to Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: um show. Shy Goodarzi: Make a case for why this Michelle Ramos: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: is Michelle Ramos: And and that's the point of like how do I make this case if Shy Goodarzi: right. Michelle Ramos: I'm not necessarily in every single conversation, right? Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: Like interacting with this person on a day-to-day basis. Shy Goodarzi: Absolutely. Okay. Super interesting. 00:11:55 Shy Goodarzi: And I feel like at another time I want to go super deep on on things like that because it's a that's a use case that I can see is really hard in any organization. Michelle Ramos: Yes, it is. Shy Goodarzi: Um okay well I'll table that for now. I want to come back to the first challenge you mentioned which is around you know capacity and resourcing and having so much to do. I'm curious if you feel that like it is harder for you

to prioritize what your team is working on or and like it are you also finding that is hard to prioritize your time and like where you should be spending like what you you're focusing your time Michelle Ramos: both things I think like um in Tennessee this is less of a problem right now in terms of like prioritizing what the team is working on because we have full autonomy thank god and so like we can just run with our plan Shy Goodarzi: Good. Michelle Ramos: and user growth is more challenging because Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: um we are at this intersection of um product requirements so products are constantly evolving and we need to up our gaming comps 00:12:58 Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Michelle Ramos: and accounts are being closed. So we have new partners with expectations and complexities that we need to navigate. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: So that that is the one and by the way like we as a organization we don't have a clear prioritization model for that like what are the the accounts that we that really matter Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: um and we would have to provide more support over others. So I mean this is just a side comment that this is more um applicable to user growth and then um when it comes to my time because I mean raia used to the just direct to consumer right like I'm I'm doing two jobs Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Michelle Ramos: and I find like I honestly like sometimes I um I question myself whether I'm doing a good job a good service to myself by Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Michelle Ramos: doing this because uh the content setting is is difficult, right? Like it's two very different worlds. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: Um yeah and actually like the the tools that I have used to try to um like thinking about my time first 00:14:09 Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Michelle Ramos: coaching like I've been talking a lot of my coach about this and um she helped me come up with like what are my essentials the key things that I need to achieve and being very very critical about the things that I join or not because as you know in the enterprise world there are so many alignment meetings Shy Goodarzi: Nice. Michelle Ramos: That is insane. Like you might spend your entire week just in alignment week uh meetings with like everyone. And Shy Goodarzi: What? Michelle Ramos: so um that's that's one like thing that I've been using. So my one-on-one coach I've also used grow as well like sometimes in my week like I just drop like I have all the things that need to be done and I don't have enough time like how should I prioritize this? And it has also helped me more with like the team level prioritization or personal level prioritization. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: So

Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Okay, that's super helpful. Um, let's see. Are there particular areas of your team's performance or development that you find hardest to influence? 00:15:23 Michelle Ramos: um so one tool that my coach Yes. The answer is yes. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Michelle Ramos: Um, I guess like where things get tricky is when there's like an emotional response to things, you Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: know, and people um feel like no, I don't feel that way, you know, like I'm I I'm super experienced in doing that, like I disagree with with this. So, um what my my coach taught me was um to be very clear about expectations like kind of prescriptive and have like smart goals in terms of development so that you can have a more um how how do you say it's it's not abstract it's it's concrete yeah more a very clear and rational conversation about like what needs to be done. So um that's what I've been trying to do with my team for instance like in in in one case in which I'm I'm coaching someone in Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: in in this role um like we have um these are the three core areas that you need to work on and these are the outcomes that we expect to have by the end of this quarter and 00:16:40 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: outcomes are like you're going to implement this forums you're going to improve how people are feeling about X Y and Z because we're going to run another 60. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Michelle Ramos: So that was something that my coach helped me Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Michelle Ramos: and then I used Chad PT basically to say okay these are the development opportunities and I need to like and um this was the 360 feedback that I got from my teammate Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Michelle Ramos: um and I need to come up with like very specific outcomes that I expect to see in the next few months. So Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: yeah, that's that's how I navigated it. Shy Goodarzi: Wow. Okay. Like there's so much that you're doing. It's insane. Um, is there anything that you spend a lot of time on that you feel is low value? Michelle Ramos: Oh wow. Um yeah, I mean there always is um One example is um screening 100 Slack channels for like what's going on. Like this is something that um I I've been one of the people uh nudging our um infosac team to give us like some sort of Slack integration that we can more 00:18:09 Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Michelle Ramos: easily do that. Um, honestly another piece is like for instance like in in some meetings that I I go to that I need to write updates and hear Shy Goodarzi: What? Michelle Ramos: updates from others. Um honestly like it's great to get to know the

team but uh you know like we have so many priorities at the moment that I feel like um not the best use of time or even like some all hands that we have Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Michelle Ramos: um honestly like Shy Goodarzi: Just give Michelle Ramos: um Shy Goodarzi: me a summary. I'll read through it. I'm good. Yeah. Michelle Ramos: yeah like I I I was telling my husband and like Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: let's not use this in the Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: transcript Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. I Michelle Ramos: but Shy Goodarzi: promise. Michelle Ramos: I was Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: telling him like I cannot believe like we spent 25 minutes on the Camino uh showcase in the pastel hands like 00:19:01 Shy Goodarzi: I Michelle Ramos: I Shy Goodarzi: know. Michelle Ramos: I I do think that that's something that we could just have quickly wrapped in five minutes and that's it. So this type of things I think are not the best use of my time. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, absolutely. I understand that. Um, okay. I'm conscious of time. I want to skip to a question, some fun questions around do you feel that you have access to the kind of data that you need to manage effectively? Michelle Ramos: Manage my team effectively. Shy Goodarzi: Or framed another way, is there data that you wish you had or insights Michelle Ramos: So, um, honestly, the 360 was a very powerful tool for for me when I got into the team because honestly like I I was a couple of months in the role and I had to provide feedback to the team and that really helped me, you know, like it it it really um makes bit more um robust than just your observation from like a a Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: few touch points a week. 00:20:13 Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Michelle Ramos: Um but the challenge with 360 is that it only happens like Shy Goodarzi: Once every Yeah. Michelle Ramos: once. Shy Goodarzi: It's a big Michelle Ramos: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: lit. Yeah. Michelle Ramos: And so uh it would be so great if and like one of the things that I've been very focused on is improving how we're collaborating in product and data sees to make sure that people have clarity and we have the right processes in place. And right now the way that I need to do that is by either like joining those meetings. So I'm I'm getting into the retros and hearing like what people Shy Goodarzi: What's Michelle Ramos: are Shy Goodarzi: going Michelle Ramos: talking Shy Goodarzi: on? Michelle Ramos: about as opportunities. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: um interviewing people in the team and seeing like what's going on and and what's still what what gaps they're still seeing. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Michelle Ramos: But I I wish I had that ongoing Shy Goodarzi:

Mhm. Michelle Ramos: uh set of like even do you remember the 55 and also like in in in Spotify we used to have the office vibe on how people were feeling and it was like a weekly post 00:21:12 Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Michelle Ramos: of like things that were going well or not. like that helps the manager because you can actually monitor things. Shy Goodarzi: in a faster pace Michelle Ramos: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: too. Michelle Ramos: This is almost like the leading indicators Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: of what you're going to see in the 360 year which is like Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: almost like too late. You already lost like six months of the Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: year uh until you find out that things were not going well. Shy Goodarzi: Right. Right. That makes a lot of sense and I would like that too. Um we've we've been hearing it from other managers as well around um that kind of like pulse information or information that's like easier to give and get and like not on like a quarterly basis but like more frequent than that. Um I'm curious uh if you could design a tool just for managers for yourself what would it do? What would it help you do? Michelle Ramos: Um, Uh, one of the things that I that I find challenging that I didn't mention up until now and 00:22:24 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: being a manager is adjusting to individual styles. So, some people need coaching to be in a certain way. Other people like even like management style. I originally had like a man management style that was way more um collaborative participative and like delegating to the teams and supporting them when they need it. And I I learned that this doesn't work to everyone for everyone Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: and for some people you need to be more prescriptive and they actually expect you to micromanage and approve Shy Goodarzi: Interesting. Michelle Ramos: everything. So um I think that alone would really help um managers um provide better support to their teams and and establish better relationships because they they can adapt to whatever style their uh direct reports have. Um although my coach would say well they also need to adapt to Shy Goodarzi: Good Michelle Ramos: you Shy Goodarzi: afternoon Michelle Ramos: at the Shy Goodarzi: you. Michelle Ramos: end of the day because you're you're actually the leader of that team which is fair point but maybe like something that gets in in between like so that you um have a more um smooth relationship. 00:23:38 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: That's one. The second one is like even uh the 101 ones is something that I've been using spending a lot of time and I worked with GPT um and grow AAI Shy Goodarzi: Good. Michelle Ramos: in trying to shape what is the right

agenda the Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: and and uh flow so that we can take more of that time. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: So even that like what is um uh helping managers with their 101 is like you Shy Goodarzi: effective time. Michelle Ramos: one could even argue like after the 101 adding the transcript what could be better like well now with Gemini notes like you can get feedback on any meeting that you have right Shy Goodarzi: Totally. Totally. Michelle Ramos: yeah Shy Goodarzi: Um I love those ideas and I know we are at time. I want to say thank you so much for Michelle Ramos: No. Shy Goodarzi: this and like your privacy will be maintained. there's nothing that will be traced back to you. I promise. Um it's just super helpful because I I actually think that this idea that building tooling for managers is like it's just a universal use case like they are struggling across the board and they are the ones that are the pressure points of the entire org. 00:24:49 Shy Goodarzi: So um I'll share more around what we find from this and yeah I'm Michelle Ramos: I Shy Goodarzi: excited Michelle Ramos: love to see that. Awesome, Sam. Good. Good job. I love that you're doing this listening tour starting with people inside the house like we have so many Shy Goodarzi: There's so many Michelle Ramos: um already to um interview. Also like one quick note I don't know if you have spoken to Fabia already have you? Shy Goodarzi: no. Michelle Ramos: So she is the new head of L & D learning Shy Goodarzi: Oh. Michelle Ramos: and development for better app. Yes. um she is not a manager uh but she's actually one of her tasks has been to really drive adoption of our products internally Shy Goodarzi: Oh, Michelle Ramos: and Shy Goodarzi: wow. Michelle Ramos: um Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Michelle Ramos: she she has a very interesting background. I think her previous job was in Tik Tok. Shy Goodarzi: Wow. Michelle Ramos: But from, yeah, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Michelle Ramos: so he's pretty aware of the challenges and needs. Shy Goodarzi: Thank you. I did not know about her. Michelle Ramos: I'm gonna pay you the name after we disconnect. Not. Likewise Shy Goodarzi: Wow. Michelle Ramos: and take.

The discussion covered team recognition, feedback mechanisms,

meeting effectiveness, team structure, and organizational alignment. Details Recognition of Work Kate Niederhoffer raised the concern that in a rapidly changing environment, the value of past work might be overlooked, leading to team members feeling underappreciated.

Kate also expressed feeling like feedback should align with organizational expectations from above, potentially overshadowing their own perspective () (). Impact of Zoom Meetings Kate Niederhoffer mentioned that the prevalence of 2D online meetings leads to increased forgetfulness and difficulty in differentiating conversations (). This makes it challenging to remember specific discussions with individuals and across teams, hindering effective cross-functional collaboration and tracking progress over time. Kate expressed a need for better tools to manage and recall the content and context of various meetings (). Meeting Structures and Information Sharing Kate Niederhoffer reflected on different types of meetings, such as those for information sharing versus dialogue and feedback. They considered the need for a typology of meeting structures to help balance time, information shared, and communication style. Kate also pondered how to make their team feel like they are growing in their careers amidst constant change (). Balancing Team Agility and Specialization Kate Niederhoffer described the tension between fostering an agile team where everyone can handle various tasks and the need for specialization where individuals excel in specific areas ().

Please provide feedback about using Gemini to take notes in a üìñ Transcript Jun 4, 2025 Manager Tooling UXR - Transcript 00:00:00 Kate Niederhoffer: I'll Shy Goodarzi: Yes, Kate Niederhoffer: say because Shy Goodarzi: please. Kate Niederhoffer: I haven't put a lot of thought into this but like one thing I've been talking about in our thought leadership is the tradeoffs of pivoting meaning that in this adaptive genai disruptive moment where things change really quickly and pivoting is necessary and exciting that um sometimes when you wrap your team around the sense of like constant change and Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Kate Niederhoffer: um and get them motivated to do so. you fail to recognize that all of the work that has been done feels underappreciated, underrevaged, under underleveraged, underrecognized and and so I think there's a need for ways to recognize people's work that don't that like uh that really makes them feel like they matter and their work matters because when you change direction, it's obvious like your work kind of doesn't matter. like it's usable in the future. Maybe the critical thinking that was involved gets you somewhere. But um I think we need more tools to say like you matter and all of that work you did even though we changed direction was 00:01:16 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: great Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: worthwhile helps us think in new ways. Like so I don't know if there's like I think recognition is probably an age-old area where there's like you know promotions and like naming that person out loud and shouting them out but like what else could we do to show like I see the work you did Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: and like let's take a moment to benefit find of everything you accomplished there. So that's something that's really on my mind because I feel hypocritical when I talk about like the importance of mattering and Shy Goodarzi: Wow. Kate Niederhoffer: betterup is a place that changes really quickly and I want to make sure that people feel like you for example the we were just talking about like do we pull someone off of manage right they've Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Kate Niederhoffer: just done a ton of analysis how Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: do I make them feel like those totally mattered they helped the product we may Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Kate Niederhoffer: have pulled you off in a way where you haven't been able to polish the deck and share it and tell people this is what I found but like it's still really good quality work and like 00:02:15 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: I feel good about it. Okay, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: so that's one thing. Um the

other idea that's on my mind a lot is feedback. I think uh it's also one of those sort of like cliche things like of course it's on my mind but Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: um how to give good feedback and Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Kate Niederhoffer: be conscious of labeling it as such. Like some I feel like, you know, I often will say like this was good, this was like this needs to be improved, but it helps so much just to be like here's some feedback. And and yet when you say that, it changes the nature of the conversation. Shy Goodarzi: Really? Kate Niederhoffer: Um and so I I and I see that consistently in my um manager reports like people want more feedback. People don't feel like I'm giving them constructive feedback. Shy Goodarzi: No. Kate Niederhoffer: Um, so like that's an issue. Another thing is like I feel like the zumification of meetings, you know, just everything being 2D 00:03:16 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: leads to a lot more forgetting and you don't know like it's really hard to differentiate a meeting from you with a meeting with whomever I have next. It's like honestly I'm just like clicking like Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: I don't have time to be like okay I have this coming up and so like so it's really hard to remember to whom I talked about what Shy Goodarzi: What? Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: um and and like I'm somebody who has a lot of one to one and Shy Goodarzi: H Kate Niederhoffer: then one to many I'm like oh what did I I think I talked about with this person this person so like is there some sort of manager toolkit where like I don't know it just helps me, you know, my most important thing is to understand who my people are, how I motivate them, not just what they're working on, but like details about like what really gets them going. And so sometimes that's just like just Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Kate Niederhoffer: like it's like the essence of someone. But I do need better tooling to know like what we talked about in which meeting, how 00:04:13 Shy Goodarzi: Huh. Kate Niederhoffer: we string it together across people for Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Kate Niederhoffer: cross functional collaboration in a respectful way. I talked to Sam about this now. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: Now I'm this part. And then also within person over time Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: um making sure that you know we're like progressing without having like it just doesn't feel right to have a Google doc for each person on my team. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. I understand. Kate Niederhoffer: So that's kind of a thing. Um what else? Um there are like I I feel like there's something about um we just when things get frantic and chaotic like I do a lot of document creation

and so like yesterday was an example where I was like the best I can do is kind of cascade this information and still a sense of overwhelm. And like so it's like I you know I'm like here's a document it's not finished. Here's another deck that is correspondent with it. I just want to orient you to the dock and like 00:05:19 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: like that's like so we talked about how like there are these different types of meetings. You know there's like the meeting where like I'm going to share information with you Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: like the type of meeting where like I'm gonna um I'm going to share something with you and then ask for dialogue and feedback. But like you know maybe sort of a typology of like meeting types to help me structure um you know it's not so much a design template but like you know how do I balance the time and type of information that I share and what style? Shy Goodarzi: Huh? Kate Niederhoffer: Um, and then like if I take the perspective of my team, how do I make them feel like they're not just growing psychologically, but they're growing in their career? Um, you know, with some consistency despite constant change. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: Um, and I feel like I I oscillate between like I wanted to create a really agile team where everyone can do everything Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. 00:06:22 Kate Niederhoffer: and and then sometimes it calls for specialization. You Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Kate Niederhoffer: know, we need like to have the right people who do the right thing at the right time. And I want to set them up for the future in a way that's like everyone can do everything. You're going to be viable for any position here. I want you to like take a turn and have like a tour of the whole organization and play different roles and meet different people. Um, but I also want to be able to say like you're the person who people go to because you're like the ace at this. Um, so like balancing that and um like I mean I I am obsessed with my team. I love them and I like to like talk them up in different places. And so that's like a challenge that I have is like I want to make sure to present them as like these powerful alltold people but also like go to this person for this. Shy Goodarzi: Got it. Wow. 00:07:17 Shy Goodarzi: So many thoughts, so many really good ideas. I love all of this. Um, where to start? Can I ask some questions? Kate Niederhoffer: Please. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. I want to go back to I think this was a point you made earlier on around feedback and about how sometimes it's it's challenging to give and there's also a cultural aspect

to it element to it. I'm curious what about feedback right now feels challenging whether that's like actually doing it in the right forums or is it the culture or is it like just a skill like a skill thing too like all of it but I want to better understand that Kate Niederhoffer: A few things come up like one is in order to give feedback it almost seems like it needs to be um the type of meeting or request where feedback is warranted or else like comments don't come across as feedback. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Kate Niederhoffer: Um, so it's like that labeling issue feels hard is like sometimes I'm like at the end of the at at the end of a presentation it's like do you have any feedback? 00:08:30 Kate Niederhoffer: It's like crap I wasn't listening for feedback. I was like Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: thinking of Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Kate Niederhoffer: storytelling it you know in the next way and so like can I call that feedback if I'm like okay what if you you know like that's not feedback. So, it you it often catches me off guard if I'm being honest. I'm like, "Oh god, I just forgot that's an important piece of the puzzle." Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: Um, and then it's um Shy Goodarzi: Interesting. Kate Niederhoffer: it's hard to like I don't I don't think in judgmental ways. I think it's hard to find behaviors that are malleable on which to give feedback. So as opposed to just you know saying like be different you know like that sometimes it feels like that that's Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: my fear is it will either come across like that or that's true that I'm Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: like well if you were different then Shy Goodarzi: This Kate Niederhoffer: you Shy Goodarzi: would Kate Niederhoffer: know Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. 00:09:27 Kate Niederhoffer: right because otherwise my default thinking is like what if we Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: you know how like it's just like I don't know there's more like we're working together on this how do we do this Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Kate Niederhoffer: and what I think they want from me is like you need Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Kate Niederhoffer: too Shy Goodarzi: To Kate Niederhoffer: like Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Yes. Kate Niederhoffer: um Shy Goodarzi: Wow. Kate Niederhoffer: and like I'm also like toggling between doesn't matter what I want. It's what my manager wants of me to want of them Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Kate Niederhoffer: or so like I'm actually like like I am like I'm like their agent, you know, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: so I don't I want them to be what somebody else wants of them. Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Kate Niederhoffer: And I view my role as like translational. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. It's like a steward. It's kind of like your Kate Niederhoffer: Yeah.

Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Kate Niederhoffer: Um and so like that that makes it particularly challen like actually like this is an instance and I wouldn't share this 00:10:32 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: um widely but um Laurian is working on an assessment vision and Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Kate Niederhoffer: I've been working really closely with him on like how to evolve it Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Kate Niederhoffer: and he and I was like this would be a good point for you to share with Gabriella Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Kate Niederhoffer: ask her some questions about like what feedback she has what direction she wants to take it in and Shy Goodarzi: Good. Kate Niederhoffer: um sent it to her and then she said to me like it would be really helpful for me if you could share the feedback you've been giving to him so that I could be aligned with it Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Kate Niederhoffer: and I was like oh this is an interesting exercise so then I had to like go back through my notes which actually are really well documented by him of like feedback from Kate like in his Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: notes and I took like you know six different versions of feedback which are really granular Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: put them into GPT and it's like okay my prompt is like I am providing feedback on the feedback that I've given to someone about this content 00:11:33 Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Kate Niederhoffer: and um like how would you summarize the main themes here and then GBT implicitly summarized it as like you should do that like as if it was feedback and I Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Kate Niederhoffer: was like no no no I'm talking about the feedback and Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Kate Niederhoffer: so then I provide this like really granular feedback of the feedback I've been giving and it was a really um anxietyprovoking experience Shy Goodarzi: Sure. Kate Niederhoffer: because I'm like like have I have I processed it through her lens of what's important and I don't know it just made me feel like that steward as opposed to someone with agency to say like Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Kate Niederhoffer: here's what I want it to be Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Yes. Kate Niederhoffer: and I do often get the feedback that I have really strong opinions and not from my team Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: from others Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Kate Niederhoffer: as a as a negative Shy Goodarzi: Interesting. Kate Niederhoffer: and like that's my default mode is like I do have strong opinions, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: but I know this isn't the place for it because I don't I don't have that level of power to have strong opinions. 00:12:31 Shy Goodarzi: Interesting. Kate Niederhoffer: And so feedback is like, and I don't know how generalizable this is, but I do think like feedback is a

token at an organization to say like what the person above you wants and you're just translating it down and what I would feed back may not Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: be relevant. So, it's hard Shy Goodarzi: That is so hard. That Kate Niederhoffer: Do Shy Goodarzi: is Kate Niederhoffer: you Shy Goodarzi: so Kate Niederhoffer: think that's Shy Goodarzi: hard. Kate Niederhoffer: true? Like is there I don't know if that's a truth. Shy Goodarzi: I think that I I can I see that. I think I would like to exist in an organization where leadership know like trust that like our opinions are actually more helpful because we're closer to everything that is currently happening. And there are things strategically that we may not see, etc. And that's why ELT is here is to give us the view of like, oh, I understand why you would get to this point, but I'm going to give you more information that you don't have to like round out your opinion and idea, 00:13:33 Kate Niederhoffer: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: right? I don't like it's scary to me if we exist in an or where we're just stewards of these things because I'm like, no, no, no. We're like really smart people and like we we want to be value ads versus Kate Niederhoffer: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: just the translation between like two different layers, Kate Niederhoffer: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: right? Kate Niederhoffer: Yeah. Are we okay? So now this reminds me of something that Brian from Google says is like Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Kate Niederhoffer: why don't my managers and directors um operate with the agency why don't they think they have as much agency as they do Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: right and this is I think this is why so like what leads to a perception that we don't have agency um and like maybe that like the thing that I don't have enough evidence for is like is this a universal truth within Shy Goodarzi: or Kate Niederhoffer: better app and outside of better app like because I think feedback for most people is hard just because it's like difficult to give 00:14:29 Shy Goodarzi: heart. Kate Niederhoffer: critical feedback Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: but an Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Kate Niederhoffer: added layer of it is like that you assume there's a right version of it and that right version is like organizationally aligned Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Yes. Oh my gosh. I could talk to you about this for hours and I want to be conscientious of your time because I know how busy you are. First off, thank you so much. It was lovely. First, it was lovely to see you. I feel like I'd love to keep touching base at some point. I'm going to meet with Rainey and I'm excited about that. Kate Niederhoffer: Great. Shy Goodarzi: Um, I will follow up after I do all my interviews to share

aggregated information about what I've learned from managers here at BetterUp of just like challenges and pain points and how we can potentially build products that can support managers. Kate Niederhoffer: Awesome. Shy Goodarzi: Um, so yeah, that's Kate Niederhoffer: Okay, Shy Goodarzi: that's the goal. Kate Niederhoffer: if you have any questions like additional ones that I didn't answer, send them and I'll think about them and I'll try to be more like, concerted about staying on topic. Shy Goodarzi: No, thank you. Kate Niederhoffer: So nice to see you Sam. Let's talk more Shy Goodarzi: No, Kate Niederhoffer: soon. Shy Goodarzi: thank you. This Kate Niederhoffer: Okay, Shy Goodarzi: was incredibly Kate Niederhoffer: bye.

Jeff Sato's main challenges include prioritizing resource allocation and guiding their team's adoption of AI, while also finding value in tools that synthesize cross-functional information for better team communication. To be a more successful manager, Jeff Sato aims to dedicate more time to team development and career growth, currently leveraging AI extensively for various tasks but cautioning against overly burdensome feedback tools and potential data misuse. Details Role and Team Responsibility Jeff Sato described their role as a director of analytics engineering, whose team is responsible for building data models for reporting and analytics. Jeff Sato noted that they currently manage six individual contributors but has managed managers in the past (). Management Experience Jeff Sato has been in a management role for approximately 12 to 15 years, including time outside of BetterUp (). They feel that BetterUp places a greater emphasis on providing training and enablement for managers. Jeff Sato mentioned that BetterUp's processes have evolved over time, but there's generally a good balance between required process and freedom for people management decisions (). Top Management Challenges Jeff Sato identified two main challenges they currently face as a manager. The first is prioritizing resource allocation across the company due to high demand for their team's support. The second challenge is helping their team members transition to and adopt AI in their work, ensuring they are enthusiastic rather than fearful (). Jeff Sato feels both they and their team face challenges in determining work priorities (). Tools for Prioritization and Efficiency Jeff Sato mentioned that clearer top-down direction on resource deployment would be helpful (). They also noted that using AI tooling has aided them in organizing information from cross-functional meetings and cascading it effectively (). Jeff Sato is experimenting with using tools like Claude and Google Drive to summarize meetings for better communication, though it's not yet perfect due to data limitations. The key information Jeff Sato tries to extract and share includes

the "why" behind decisions and the context and roles of involved parties (). Challenges in Team Performance and Development Jeff Sato finds it challenging to influence relationship building between their team and cross-functional stakeholders (). Another area they find hard to influence is project management skills within their team, as many team members handle their own project management, leading to varying levels of proficiency (). Desired Data and Insights for Management Jeff Sato stated that stakeholder feedback obtained early and consistently would be valuable for managing their team (). They would like more substantive feedback beyond multiple-choice survey answers, including cross-functional perspectives on team performance and areas for improvement (). Shy Goodarzi suggested recording conversations for feedback, which could be synthesized with AI (). Jeff Sato acknowledged the scaling challenges of this approach but considered it for targeted feedback (). Tools Used for Team Management Jeff Sato uses weekly one-on-ones with regular feedback for performance management. They also utilize BetterUp's standard processes like half-yearly check-ins and yearly reviews, along with a customized leveling rubric that now includes an AI component (). For managing work, their team uses Jira and the Atlassian tool suite. They also implement a six-month promotion readiness process for eligible team members (). Low-Value Activities for Managers Jeff Sato identified some large, recurring cross-functional meetings with many attendees as potentially low-value, often consisting of status updates that could be handled asynchronously or less frequently. Jeff Sato feels these meetings can be redundant and consume time that could be used more effectively (). Ideal Tool for Managers Jeff Sato reiterated that a tool to synthesize cross-functional information and facilitate cascading key points to their team and manager would be the most helpful. They are actively working on developing such a tool but haven't yet achieved optimal functionality (). Defining Successful Management Jeff Sato believes that in six months to a year, being a more successful manager would involve having more time to focus on people development and career growth for their team members, rather than constantly being reactive to tactical issues (). Current Use of AI in Management Jeff Sato reported using AI extensively on a daily basis for various tasks such as writing memos, building slide decks, and brainstorming ideas (). They use AI as an "expert" to refine their thinking on technical issues. Jeff Sato is also trying to leverage AI for organizing their own data and improving information cascades (). Things to Avoid in Manager Tooling Jeff Sato advised against building feedback forms that are too time-consuming, as people won't complete them. They also cautioned against tools that increase the workload for managers (). Jeff Sato emphasized the importance of maintaining a personal touch in manager-IC relationships and not over-relying on AI for tasks like performance reviews to the point of making them generic (). Concerns Regarding Data in Management Systems Jeff Sato raised concerns about the potential misuse of candid feedback data collected in centralized systems (). They emphasized that feedback should aim to

help individuals grow and not be used punitively or solely for company optimization through employee attrition (). Jeff Sato highlighted the importance of data privacy and security within internal systems (). Suggested next steps Jeff Sato will explore alternative methods for gathering stakeholder feedback, such as having conversations recorded with Gemini for synthesis. You should review Gemini's notes to make sure they're accurate.

So, I'm just going to ask some questions about you as a manager. And the first question I have is um can you tell me or can you describe your role and what your team is responsible for? Jeff Sato: I'm a director of analytics engineering. Um, my team is responsible for building data models for reporting and analytics. Shy Goodarzi: It's a great team. Um how long have you been in a management role? um out like including time outside of better. Jeff Sato: Good question. I don't even know the answer. I haven't thought about it, but like um Oh, man. Over I don't know. Yeah, I would say 15 years, maybe 12 Shy Goodarzi: Wow, Jeff Sato: years, I don't know, something like Shy Goodarzi: that's Jeff Sato: that. Shy Goodarzi: incredible. Uh how many people do you manage currently? Jeff Sato: six I think Shy Goodarzi: Don't worry, other managers have said the same thing like a dot dot dot I think. Um, okay. Is do you manage individual contributors, managers, or both? 00:01:11 Jeff Sato: uh right now just individual contributors but I have managed managers as well. Shy Goodarzi: Got it. And um you it sounds like you've managed in other organizations before. If given that how does this experience compare? Okay. Jeff Sato: Great question. Um, I would say there's more of an emphasis on making sure that we're we have like training and enablement to do a good job as a manager at BetterUp. Shy Goodarzi: Huh? Jeff Sato: And I would say, well, better up it changes quite a bit. Um, so sometimes there was like um not a lot of process, sometimes there's been quite a bit of process. Um, but I think in general it's like there's a good balance between like how much process they require and how much freedom they give us to like make our own decisions about people management. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Interesting. Um, okay. Taking a step back, can you share your top two to three challenges that you face as a manager right now? Jeff Sato: right now. Um, good question. 00:02:26 Jeff Sato: I mean, I think is this people management or just like management in general? Shy Goodarzi: Uh, that's a good question. I'll I'll let you like take it whichever way you want. Jeff Sato: Okay, cool. Um I would say because we are such like a surface uh or within better

up Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Jeff Sato: it's like trying to b like juggle um where we uh provide resources to across the company like how do we juggle that prioritization and like you know we have lots of people that need help. So how do we decide like who gets resources and who gets less resources is the first one. Shy Goodarzi: Huh? Jeff Sato: Um and then I think the second one I'll go for like the people angle. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Jeff Sato: Um I think it's like um you know really trying to help people. I was going to be kind of generic because you hear this probably from everybody but really helping people. um transition and adopt like AI in their work Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: and like Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Jeff Sato: you know making sure that people are excited about it and not scared of it, right? 00:03:40 Shy Goodarzi: Oh, that's so interesting. Um I'm curious because you mentioned like as a company um the challenges of prioritizing is that something you feel you face every day with your your individual contributors of like where do I put them and like what like what is the most important thing right now? Jeff Sato: Yes, I feel like both I face that challenge and then Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Jeff Sato: both and then the people that work for me also face that challenge on like what should they be working on. Shy Goodarzi: totally. And is there anything that you can think of that like in that challenge like what would be helpful to you? Jeff Sato: Um yeah, that's really interesting. I mean, it's one thing that we're actually working on right now, which is just getting more clarity top down for like how we um deploy resources and um how other teams go about asking for resources, like how does our org structure actually work at BetterUp and can we get executive buy in? Uh and we we actually just pitched folks on this like last week. 00:04:54 Shy Goodarzi: Oh, that's Jeff Sato: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: awesome. Um, is there anything in your daytoday of like your prioritization or of your like kind of your own management of yourself that would be helpful in in kind of being a manager or making it more easy for you? Jeff Sato: Um, it's a good question. Uh, like prioritizing my time. Is that what you're asking? Shy Goodarzi: I that was just an example, but like is there anything today that like feels like you like it could help you be more efficient or help you do your job better or help you understand team performance better? Jeff Sato: Um, yeah, maybe that's a good one. I was going to say, you know, obviously using AI tooling has helped me a lot. Um, and I think the thing that I've been trying to use it for that maybe I haven't perfected is

um with uh organizing information that I that I pick up in all these different crossunctional meetings and then cascading it both up and down. Shy Goodarzi: That's awesome. So, do you just like put everything into kind of GBT and then like summarize it? 00:06:16 Jeff Sato: Yeah. So, I've been doing this thing where I've like hooked up Claude to Google Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Jeff Sato: Drive and then like trying to like build a tool from Claude to like summarize all my meetings and things um for Cascades. It's not perfect though. I haven't got it to like really work perfectly Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Jeff Sato: and I'm running into like data limitations and rate limiting and things like that. So, I Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Jeff Sato: think that that would be I always think that that would be the greatest tool as like a way just to because I'm in like eight hours of meetings a day. How do I summarize all of that even for my own self? But then like Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: as I cast it out, Shy Goodarzi: What's the type of information that you think is useful to ba basically understand like oh I should be cascading this up or down or vice versa? Like what are you parsing Jeff Sato: right? Shy Goodarzi: out? Jeff Sato: Yes. Um I think the biggest thing is the the like the why around decisions that are made, 00:07:08 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: right? and Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: some of the context behind Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. It's Jeff Sato: like Shy Goodarzi: interesting. Jeff Sato: um and so like when we go off and start a project it's like people want the context about like what's behind the decision, why are we doing this? And then like Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Jeff Sato: um who else is who all is involved and what are their roles? Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Yeah. Clarity. Um, super helpful. Um, are there part we're kind of going to bounce around a little bit, but are there particular areas of your team's performance or development that you find hardest to influence? Jeff Sato: Um, I would say hardest to influence. Yeah, maybe there's two. Like one I was going to say was um the like relationship building with stakeholders because they're so crossf functional and so embedded like Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Jeff Sato: you know really I don't know coaching on how to really build those relationships of trust Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Jeff Sato: and then maybe the second one is um oh my gosh I just forgotten the second one was more impactful than the first uh can you restate the question so it'll like make me remember 00:08:38 Shy Goodarzi: No, it's okay. Jeff Sato: what Shy Goodarzi: Are Jeff Sato: was Shy Goodarzi: there Jeff Sato: it? Shy Goodarzi: particular areas of your team's performance or development that you find hardest to influence?

Jeff Sato: Oh yeah, I think the second one is really around like product project management because we require so much of that project management because we don't have PMs in that like data or Shy Goodarzi: What? Jeff Sato: that they Shy Goodarzi: What? Jeff Sato: do a lot of their own project management. So I think that there's like uh a very like wide uh spectrum of how well people do that and then Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Jeff Sato: we have some people that are really really good at it and Shy Goodarzi: No. Jeff Sato: some people that are like less good at it and it's hard to kind of raise those folks proficiency there because I think it's like partly personality based and Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Jeff Sato: um Cool. Shy Goodarzi: Um, I'm going to skip to a question that it could be related to that question or it could be just generally. 00:09:32 Shy Goodarzi: Um, what data or insights would you want to help inform like your management of your team? Jeff Sato: What data runs? That's what I want to help me better manage my team. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. So basically what kinds of insights or Jeff Sato: Uh, Shy Goodarzi: data or reports would help you be a better manager in your mind. Jeff Sato: cool. I'll give you some some easy ones maybe. Um, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: uh, I mean, one thing that we've been trying to do, but, uh, it's it's a little bit hard, but, um, is to get stakeholder feedback Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Jeff Sato: early, um, but we it's a little bit inconsistent. Um, a lot of that's like it's hard to get folks to respond and then it's like hard for probably I could do a better job of just like following up andounding people to give us that feedback. But Shy Goodarzi: What? Jeff Sato: like I think that that is super helpful if we could have date more data on Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, the like cross Jeff Sato: like 00:10:34 Shy Goodarzi: functional view. Jeff Sato: yes crossf Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Jeff Sato: functional view of performance of my team and what folks could do better and what folks are like really good at. like Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Jeff Sato: we send out it's you know like a survey and most people Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: like give the like multiple choice answers but we don't get a lot of like the actual information like give me like real hard feedback in text form I think that that would be really valuable right because I'm pretty try and be pretty handsoff Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: um and let them own the relationship and so then it's hard for me to really know Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, I get that. Um Jeff Sato: beyond when things go wrong and then people reach out and then I'm like okay I

can work on that with them but I don't you know, beyond like the multiple choice answers we get back on that survey. That's about the extent of Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Jeff Sato: what we get. Shy Goodarzi: Is that the 360? Does the 360 do multiple choice? 00:11:22 Shy Goodarzi: I Jeff Sato: Um, Shy Goodarzi: actually never Jeff Sato: we don't we use like a Google form Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Jeff Sato: that we just send out. Maybe Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Jeff Sato: we should start using the 360. I'm not we I want something like like the one we do is two minutes. It's like Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: I don't know, six questions. It's really fast. So, we like want to keep the barrier to entry really low. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: Not like a 20 minute evaluation. Shy Goodarzi: We'll see. Jeff Sato: like a two-minute answer these quick questions, but it would be great to get a little bit more. Uh, Shy Goodarzi: Wow. Jeff Sato: but then once we do that, we don't get responses. Shy Goodarzi: It's so interesting because I I think it's like obviously like there's a trade-off between the like multiple choice answers and then the like obviously open text fields which it's hard to get people to fill it out. I wonder if there's a way in which like someone speaking about it is easier for them. 00:12:05 Shy Goodarzi: It's like could I just talk about my relationship with Jeff and like and then that's like synthesized Jeff Sato: All right. Shy Goodarzi: easily like paired down to whatever you need like I would talk to like that feels easier to me to give feedback that way than like oh let me type out something about the typing feels ownorous in my Jeff Sato: That's Shy Goodarzi: mind. Jeff Sato: actually a great call. Maybe I'll Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Jeff Sato: try that this coming quarter. Just get people on a call, record it with Gemini, and then Shy Goodarzi: that's what I mean UXR has like cut down to like a less than like a third of the time because I'm just like it can synthesize everything for me. I just actually have to have the conversation with people. So it's like Jeff Sato: Right. Shy Goodarzi: can you capture the data and can you make that so frictionless that people are willing to give you that and then it's like simple from there. Jeff Sato: Right. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. Jeff Sato: Obviously Shy Goodarzi: Okay. 00:12:51 Jeff Sato: hard a little bit hard to scale because then I have to like get on a call for 15 minutes with like 25 people, but like at least I'll get feedback. Maybe I just tailor it to folks that I really need a little bit more. Shy Goodarzi: Right. Or could they send you a voice note that Jeff Sato: Right. Shy Goodarzi: you

can try to transcribe? I don't know. Something like that. Jeff Sato: through your Shy Goodarzi: Um, Jeff Sato: top. Shy Goodarzi: okay. Great. What kind of tools today do you currently use to manage your team? Eg like spreadsheets, there's like the job level stuff, there's work day. Like what do you use today? Jeff Sato: Good call. So, managing performance is Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: that performance manage. Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Jeff Sato: So, for performance management, right, I mean we do weekly one-on ones where we provide feedback weekly. I try to provide like pretty much weekly feedback. Um, and then we do all the standard stuff that better requires like the I don't know is it halfearly check-in and 00:13:49 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Jeff Sato: then the like Shy Goodarzi: that's Jeff Sato: yearly review cycle and we do use the leveling rubric. Um, and so our team we update our leveling rubric probably at least once a year but we tweak it a little bit for our specific job functions. Um and we just added like an AI component into it. Um so we use leveling rubric and then we just also launched a separate like AI uh proficiency uh rubric as well. Um so we use those really to like have people focus on performance and then when we are we we also do like promotion readiness. Um, I do like a four folks that are like close. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Jeff Sato: We do like a sixmonth uh we write up a dock and then we track progress towards that over a Shy Goodarzi: cool. Jeff Sato: six month about a six-month period. Shy Goodarzi: Cool. Jeff Sato: Um, I'm trying to think what else for work like managing their work and stuff. We use Jira Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Jeff Sato: um Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. 00:14:49 Jeff Sato: and Atlas and whatever the whole the whole Shy Goodarzi: Tools. Jeff Sato: Atlassian Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Jeff Sato: tool set for that. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Um, this is really helpful. I'm curious. Um, do you feel like there's anything that you spend a decent amount of time on that you think is low value? Jeff Sato: in terms of people management or just in general? Shy Goodarzi: in terms of you as like a I would say just like in terms of you as a manager it could be people management it could be you trying to drive performance I guess the same thing Jeff Sato: Right. Um I don't know. I think people management is pretty valuable. So it's hard to think about you know like I don't know like recurring meetings like Shy Goodarzi: No, that's Jeff Sato: uh Shy Goodarzi: exactly Jeff Sato: but that's Shy Goodarzi: it. Jeff Sato: not Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: like people management that's more like just you know cross functional alignment things but like the some recurring meetings that like are redundant with

other like I don't know I have a few that maybe same people overlap in most areas and then there's like three of these things that happen weekly 00:16:00 Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Jeff Sato: or bi-weekly and I'm like they're kind of all the same thing. Why are we all meeting three times a week? Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Um, I actually didn't mean the so you this isn't awesome. I do Jeff Sato: Okay. Shy Goodarzi: want to re ask the question of like it actually doesn't need to have to do with performance management. It's about your time. Like Jeff Sato: Oh, Shy Goodarzi: is there Jeff Sato: got Shy Goodarzi: anything Jeff Sato: it. Shy Goodarzi: doing generally that you're like h that's just not worth it. Jeff Sato: I think yeah like some of the recurring like big recurring meetings that have 25 people in them Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: um Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: that are a lot of like status updates which I think you know like can be valuable but a lot of times are are less valuable that probably could be done either cut down into single meetings or less frequent or async or Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. And generally in those meetings, what is your what what is your uh what are you generally doing? 00:16:52 Shy Goodarzi: Is it just like information sharing from others to you? Is it generally like what's what are you kind of doing in those meetings? The ones that feel sometimes not helpful, useful. Jeff Sato: It's probably crossf functional uh information sharing or status update. updates, right? I think in a lot of them, people give their updates and then stop paying attention to other people's updates unless something like catches their ear, you know, and so um and people give the same updates in multiple meetings. And so like, you know, especially if I've heard it before, like the day before, it seems less valuable. Shy Goodarzi: like what am I doing? Yeah, that's uh that is very this is a very common comment from managers. It's like the idea that like your time is precious because you are spread so thin as a manager generally here. It's like how do we decrease the number of meetings that you're in that just don't feel relevant or helpful in any way? Um, and Jeff Sato: Right. Shy Goodarzi: help you prioritize the meetings that are helping towards the goals that you have and depp prioritizing those that just don't fall into the priority list. 00:18:02 Shy Goodarzi: Um, Jeff Sato: Yes. Shy Goodarzi: okay. If you could design a tool just for managers like yourself, what would it help you do? Jeff Sato: I mean, I think I just the one I talked about earlier, which is um being able to synthesize cross functional information, distill it down to things that need to be cascaded down to my team and up to my man,

like my manager, I think would be the Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Jeff Sato: most helpful. um working on something like that, but I haven't figured out how to get it perfectly uh in a good spot. But I think that that would be really really Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: helpful. Um because I think that that's like really valuable part of the Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: job. Shy Goodarzi: totally. Jeff Sato: Uh, and I'm sure lots of like lots of things get missed by managers in general when you sit through so many cross functional meetings and you try your hardest to like jot things down, remember them, cascade them that I'm sure like there are holes in that kind of stuff and then people get slightly incomplete information and you think you're doing a great job, but you probably are missing things. 00:19:14 Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Yes. Okay. Um I'm curious. Let's see. What would for you what would being a more successful manager look like in six months to to a a year? Jeff Sato: It's a great question. Um, I mean, in general, I always think having more time to be able to spend on like people development or career development with the folks I Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: that work for me instead of like always Shy Goodarzi: Practical. Jeff Sato: like having to default to tactical, right? It's like you go in with the best intentions and then something comes up where there's some emergency or some fire and then you're like I know we were going Shy Goodarzi: What? Jeff Sato: to review like you know some cool career development stuff but like sorry today we have to like put out this fire in your Shy Goodarzi: totally Jeff Sato: one-on-one. Um and so I think if if there was a way I don't know it's it's like similar to product development where you want to build for the future but then you get hung 00:20:31 Shy Goodarzi: the Jeff Sato: up Shy Goodarzi: short Jeff Sato: on Shy Goodarzi: term. Jeff Sato: like customer commitments. Shy Goodarzi: It's Jeff Sato: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: so real. That is a really big pain point and it's a good call out. Um, is there you mentioned a little bit about how you're using AI today in your management, which is kind of synthesizing information and being able to share that cascade more easily up and down the chain. Is there anything else you're using AI for? Jeff Sato: I mean, I kind of now use it all the time every day Shy Goodarzi: Great. Yeah. Jeff Sato: to write. I don't know. To Yeah. write memos to build slide decks to um I mean I kind of almost everything except for this call where I'm having to use my brain because we're talking live. Um, I mean I'm trying to use it Shy Goodarzi: That's Jeff Sato: forever. Shy Goodarzi: great. Jeff

Sato: Like I use it a lot for ideiation Shy Goodarzi: Okay, Jeff Sato: as well Shy Goodarzi: that's great. 00:21:24 Jeff Sato: when I'm like, hey, I have this idea about something like it would be like, you know, this piece of our like data platform architecture doesn't seem to be working correctly. I have this idea, but I'm not necessarily like an IC anymore and don't keep up with like modern data architectures. So I'm like, "Hey, what do you think about this?" And like use it to like it's an expert Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Jeff Sato: on everything. So we riff back and forth until I get something cool. And I'm Shy Goodarzi: That's Jeff Sato: like, "Wow, Shy Goodarzi: so cool. Jeff Sato: that's great." It either validated what I was thinking or it gives me Shy Goodarzi: That's Jeff Sato: new Shy Goodarzi: awesome. Jeff Sato: ideas, like things like that. Um, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: so I use it for ideiation, I use it for tactical stuff, getting things Shy Goodarzi: Wow. Jeff Sato: done. And then I'm trying to use it for more interesting things Shy Goodarzi: Okay, Jeff Sato: like ingesting my own data and being able to like organize my life and my 00:22:14 Shy Goodarzi: that's Jeff Sato: cascades. Shy Goodarzi: awesome. Jeff Sato: But Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: that's Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Jeff Sato: work in progress Shy Goodarzi: So, cool. Um, you are definitely an AI pilot, which is cool to see. Um Jeff Sato: which I don't feel I feel like I'm behind always Shy Goodarzi: I mean Jeff Sato: you know that's and maybe everybody Shy Goodarzi: no Jeff Sato: does but yeah you're Shy Goodarzi: I'm Jeff Sato: like Shy Goodarzi: I'm way behind Jeff Sato: I think I'm trying to do cool stuff but I feel way behind. Shy Goodarzi: I'm way behind you and I feel like very far behind and I think the hurdle for me is like the effort to like learn and get to a place where it becomes easier to like know how to leverage and go faster cuz right now I'm like the the time it takes me to write the right prompt. I could have just done it Jeff Sato: right? Shy Goodarzi: like manually. And so I think I just need to like get better at prompting. Jeff Sato: Yeah. 00:23:00 Jeff Sato: You just get less and less uh hard on yourself about your prompts. Shy Goodarzi: Um Jeff Sato: I just had it planned like my son's seventh birthday party. a cruise around Marina del Ray on Oduffy and I was like I need a route. I need a like scavenger hunt like thing. Figure it out. Shy Goodarzi: I just did it. Jeff Sato: Like yeah I mean it's can do anything you want. Shy Goodarzi: I love it. Jeff Sato: My wife was like I have to spend all day

doing this thing and I was like how about I just do this Shy Goodarzi: Incredible. Jeff Sato: in 10 minutes real quick. But yeah, anything it Shy Goodarzi: It says Jeff Sato: does Shy Goodarzi: everything. Jeff Sato: everything. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Well, we are getting close to time and my question to you would be like this is a weird one, but if we were to build manager tools, tooling for managers that would make their lives easier, what would be something you'd want us to avoid or what what would you say like don't do or don't focus on 00:23:57 Jeff Sato: Um. Oh, don't focus on like not like don't make this mistake, Shy Goodarzi: either. Jeff Sato: but don't even focus Shy Goodarzi: either Jeff Sato: on this area. Shy Goodarzi: either of them. Jeff Sato: Okay. Well, like earlier I was saying like I would love some like really easy cross functional feedback Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: form, but build it so you actually get people to respond. Like I can't send a 360 or whatever that takes 25 minutes for them to fill out. They just Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: won't do it. So build something that's like Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: whatever user Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: focused. Um is one. Uh what's another one? Um similarly don't build something that's going to like increase the amount of work I have to do, Shy Goodarzi: You mash. Jeff Sato: right? like, "Hey, we built this thing where like we're gonna do bi-weekly performance Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Jeff Sato: reviews." And I'm like, "Oh my god, I can barely do it like four times a year. Now 00:24:58 Jeff Sato: it's two Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Jeff Sato: times a year, so it's a Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: lot better. But like if you want me to do this every two weeks, this is going to be like Shy Goodarzi: Totally. Jeff Sato: insane." Um, the other thing that I balance is trying to um like lean into AI but still make the like manager IC relationship feel Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: personal. So like don't overengineer it with AI to where it comes out being like very generic and Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: like Shy Goodarzi: Of Jeff Sato: I still like to use it a little bit but kind of write my own performance reviews a little bit so that it like is actually Shy Goodarzi: course. Jeff Sato: meaningful. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. Jeff Sato: Um are Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Jeff Sato: those helpful? Shy Goodarzi: All good points. Um, is there anything else you'd want to share related to being a manager or things that you like wish we would we would do or focus on? Jeff Sato: There's another interesting thing here where like we've talked about this a little bit but um it's a little like when you build 00:26:04 Shy

Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: a system the data behind it can be a little bit worrisome Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: like if we're doing if we're doing feedback and performance Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: right um I want to be able to provide really candid feedback Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: in able to help these people, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: right? You're like, you manage people because you want them to like succeed Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: in life, not necessarily in a better just in life. But if I want to give like real candid feedback, I don't want that somehow to then be used against them or against me, less so against me, but against them, right? And so it's a little bit scary when you're building this like centralized Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: system where all this data Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: is Shy Goodarzi: It's Jeff Sato: going Shy Goodarzi: being Jeff Sato: in Shy Goodarzi: captured. Jeff Sato: that Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. And also, what isn't Jeff Sato: like Shy Goodarzi: being captured? Jeff Sato: what's going to happen with 00:26:47 Shy Goodarzi: And Jeff Sato: this Shy Goodarzi: is Jeff Sato: data. Shy Goodarzi: that biased? Right. Jeff Sato: Right. Shy Goodarzi: Of course it is. Yeah. Yeah. Jeff Sato: Exactly. So yeah, you like if it gets used in the wrong way then it's like really really awful because like the whole point of this thing is to help Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Jeff Sato: people grow. Um, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, it's a really good point. Jeff Sato: I don't want it to be used to help the company continually optimize, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Jeff Sato: meaning like moving people on because like I gave feedback that was like trying to Shy Goodarzi: a Jeff Sato: help somebody Shy Goodarzi: thousand%. Jeff Sato: grow. Shy Goodarzi: I think it's a really good call and one that I think many of our partners would also not want. Um so yeah it can't be it's like that's a really good point around like the like um what is this data being used for and it's not like thought of as the whole picture because it can never be and like in terms of performance I feel like feedback should be like there should be performance reviews but there should just be feedback for feedback and not related to like performance because I think that that would just like feel really heavy to members. 00:27:50 Shy Goodarzi: to people. Jeff Sato: Right. And this whole like idea of data privacy or data security is really important especially internally. I remember when Seini first got here and he was telling me how like one of the core values at Apple was that like no employee could see any anybody's data at all individual data. You could never see any individual person's data Shy Goodarzi: That's Jeff Sato: on anything. He's

like, I could have better up and like everyone looks at everyone's data like Shy Goodarzi: real. Jeff Sato: and it scared Shy Goodarzi: It's real. Jeff Sato: me and he was like you should like and I was like that should be a core principle of something like this because like Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Jeff Sato: unintentionally you build a system and you're like it's not what it's intended for but then if somebody has access to it you never know how it can be misused. Shy Goodarzi: thank you for the reminder and thank you for your time. It was so good to see you. I'm gonna find the next month or so. Maybe we can get together and just chat like catch Jeff Sato: Must. Shy Goodarzi: up and see. Okay. Jeff Sato: But are you Oh yeah. You're in New York, right? Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Yeah.

Key challenges for Scott Baker include balancing managerial duties with individual contributions, capacity planning, and optimizing cross-functional communication. Scott Baker also shared their approaches to team growth, performance tracking, and desired tools to improve management and team alignment. Details Team Responsibilities Scott Baker leads the experience architecture team, which focuses on three key areas: creating new skill-building experiences, maintaining current experiences, and managing a vetted resource reference for the platform (). The team leverages AI to handle a significant amount of work, equivalent to one to two people (). Management Experience and Challenges Scott Baker has eight years of management experience, and their current role is the first time managing a purely virtual team across time zones (). A major challenge for Scott Baker is balancing individual contributions with managerial responsibilities, finding it difficult to delegate tasks like partner calls and content review due to existing relationships and the expert nature of the work (). They also struggle with capacity planning for the team to set realistic expectations and determine when additional resources are needed (). Prioritization and Low-Value Tasks The team prioritizes work monthly, reviewing past accomplishments and upcoming tasks in a dedicated session, and they are implementing Jira for better tracking with owners and deadlines (). Scott Baker feels most of their work is valuable but suggests that more demos and configurations could potentially be handled outside of their team with the right tooling and

escalation processes (). The volume of meetings, especially those requiring multiple prep sessions before demos, is a concern (). Communication Hurdles and Solutions Within their small team, Scott Baker does not perceive significant communication hurdles, but cross-functionally, the challenge lies in knowing when to inform other teams about evolving work without necessarily scheduling a meeting (). Scott Baker suggests a system with triggers that automatically notify relevant individuals or teams when their work might be affected by ongoing developments, possibly leveraging AI to scan documents for relevant topics () (). Improved visibility and early alignment on initiatives could prevent later rework (). Team Growth and Development Scott Baker supports team member growth through monthly one-on-one discussions focused on development and by assigning relevant books for the team to read and discuss. Aligning with formal development check-in cycles is also part of their approach (). A challenge in managing direct reports is accurately gauging their capacity without feeling intrusive, emphasizing the need for clear goals and outcomes while remaining aware of potential overload (). Performance Tracking and Helpful Data The team is currently working on defining team-level metrics to track performance (). Individually, performance is primarily assessed by keeping commitments and meeting assigned timelines (). Scott Baker believes that flow-of-work feedback, such as real-time feedback during team calls or tools that assess if meeting intentions are met, could be more helpful than traditional peer feedback, which is difficult to gather meaningfully in a virtual environment (). They expressed skepticism towards AI feedback tools that lack context (). Ideal Tools for Managers Scott Baker envisions a tool that streamlines routine management tasks like monthly priority reviews and development conversations by allowing managers to plan their year and automate reminders and prompts for these activities () (). Another desired tool would aid in team alignment by ensuring everyone understands and is focused on top priorities, possibly through playful or integrated methods that provide signals on whether key messages are being heard and acted upon. These tools should be seamless and integrated into the flow of work, providing timely prompts and relevant information () (). Suggested next steps Scott Baker will try to figure out and get a hold of a good way to forecast the team's capacity to (1) set realistic expectations, and (2) determine when more resources are needed.

Can you describe your current role and what your team is responsible for? Maybe Scott Baker: That's not Shy Goodarzi: not a Scott Baker: a Shy Goodarzi: softball. It's true. You do everything. Scott Baker: Yeah. No, I I lead our experience architecture team. Uh and and our team is I would say we're responsible for three things. One is creating new experiences that help people develop and build new skills. Uh the second is um

we have to maintain the experience uh set that we we have today. What did I say? Three things. Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Scott Baker: So um and then the final thing is is you know that I see ourselves being responsible for is managing um kind of the the the resource reference of what vetted frameworks, Shy Goodarzi: Simple. Scott Baker: tools, luminaries are so that they can be infused into the platform experience. Yes. Shy Goodarzi: Uh, okay. How long have you been in a management role? Um, not just at Better Up. 00:01:16 Scott Baker: just a better I'd say let's let's say eight years. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Scott Baker: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: And how many people do you currently manage? Scott Baker: Two Shy Goodarzi: And do you manage IC's or managers of both? Scott Baker: I individual contributors. Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Scott Baker: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: And um since you've managed at other organizations before, how does this experience compare? Scott Baker: Um, honestly, it's the first time I've managed a per pure virtual team. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Scott Baker: Um, so that's a distinct difference. So, and obviously time zone differences Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: uh as well as just space differences that's fundamentally different. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: Um I think and as a result of that the tools that we use to interact with and collaborate I mean all those are fundamentally different Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: too. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: Um, and then the final thing is is I don't know. I already feel like we're managing agents. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: So, this is by far the first time of like having AI do a pretty significant amount of work 00:02:52 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Scott Baker: on our team. I would say that Yeah. like one to two people's worth. Shy Goodarzi: I'm glad I'm talking to you. We've got Scott Baker: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: a lot to talk about. Um, Scott Baker: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: okay. If we back up a little bit, can you share with me the top two to three challenges that you currently face as a manager? Scott Baker: I mean I think are perpetual challenges. Um there's still a gap I think between like like I own I just still own a lot of stuff. I'm very much a doer Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: and and I don't think it's a lack of delegation but you know so it's like but it's just it's just I don't know that I can delegate a lot of these things like like all these partner calls Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Scott Baker: and demos and I mean I can't just hey you take this Shy Goodarzi: come Scott Baker: one Shy Goodarzi: out. Scott Baker: this one Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: and you know I you've got this residual like network effect right because I've been in the company for

a while like I pull into things that if somebody new came into this role, they wouldn't be tapped for at all. 00:04:21 Shy Goodarzi: Totally. Scott Baker: I think that's a reality. So, I think that the my biggest challenge is like pushing back and saying no on those things so that I can still focus on the the core team stuff. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: But but even then the challenge number two is is we're building um you know expert level content and I'm still have to be in the loop like from a review process. So I can't delegate that stuff either. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: Yeah. So I'd say the hardest time is like it's still like being able to to not just be doing all the time to also be thinking about like oh think about the team and think about the function all those kinds of things. Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Scott Baker: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Um, how do you prioritize today? Like your time and your team's time. Scott Baker: Yeah. I mean, so what we what we do do is every month we have a we kind of, you know, we went through the process, obviously set our goals. We put together a product roadmap, like 00:05:25 Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: here's here's everything we're going to do by quarter, but each month we kind of have a looking backward, looking forward Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: team session. So we have one session dedicated to that each month. Now it's like, oh, what did we do last month? All right, what are the big things that we have this month? So that we grew up on it and now we're starting to manage all that in Jira so that we just actually put actual like owners Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Scott Baker: deadlines, times and everything to that. So Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: that's what we're trying to do. Um uh but you know you have to revisit it like all the time because Shy Goodarzi: Constantly changing new asks coming in. Yeah. Scott Baker: But the Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: other thing things that Yeah. we need and I want to try to get like so here's a challenge is just like h having a good way to forecast our capacity. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Scott Baker: So that's something I I want to try to figure out and get a hold of both for a couple reasons. 00:06:24 Scott Baker: one to like be able to set realistic expectations about here's what we can do and then also to then be able to say okay here's when we need more and Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: I I don't have a tool for that right now and I need one Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: so so I'm trying to like map out like okay here's how long this work takes so both from a cycle

time and input time so that we just have a model says oh you want to do this this is what it's going to take Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Mhm. Scott Baker: so that's a huge thing that's a huge challenge challenges Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: and not saying and then as a result not committing to too much that we can't do. Shy Goodarzi: Totally. Um I will share that that is a pervasive feeling across the Scott Baker: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: organization of just like uh I'm being asked to do everything and we don't have the capacity to do it. How do I figure that out? So Scott Baker: Yeah. 00:07:13 Shy Goodarzi: it's yeah very prevalent challenge. Scott Baker: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: I'm curious if there's anything that you do on a day-to-day weekly basis that Scott Baker: Mhm. Shy Goodarzi: you find is low value or you don't think you should be spending your time doing. Scott Baker: anything that's low value. Well, I mean, I definitely think there are things that I'm doing that other people in the organization should do. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: I I wouldn't call it low value, though. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, that's fair. That's fair. Yeah. Scott Baker: Um um and and and so I I I do feel like like um you know you more demos should be done outside and you know and there should be like a escalation process when when we get called in versus like just a first demo. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: Um I feel like from our team perspective where we want to get to is even configurations and things like that like oh how do we line plans or what elements I feel like all of that could be part of a design process or the configuration process someday. 00:08:32 Scott Baker: So if Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: we build the right tooling and everything that could go um outside of us as well. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: But like do I feel like stuff I do is low value? you know, not surprisingly not really. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: Maybe just too many meetings, but I don't know how we get around that. I mean, because I'm pretty good at saying no to meetings that that I don't feel like I'm adding any value in. But the thing that kills me is it, and I know you share this, is like it's never a demo. It's a demo plus two or three prep meetings. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Are there any current meetings on your calendar that you you're saying you say no to ones that you don't feel like you're uh helpful in or that you're Scott Baker: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: not getting information? Um, yeah. Are there any other meetings that you feel like um well, I feel like I'm going to lead you on this question, so I'm going to not do that.

00:09:40 Shy Goodarzi: Um, I'm going to ask you a different question. Uh, can you tell me what the biggest communication hurdles are that you face with your team or other teams? Scott Baker: Ah, I mean, we're such a small team that it's not that problematic. I mean, three people, it's not a lot of process loss, which is great. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: Um, so I personally don't feel like we have like like I see any huge gaps there. I think I think it's bigger crossf functionally and and the biggest ones cross functionally is just like knowing when you should be informing somebody of you know because again things rapidly evolve and it's like oh when when you know it's like oh I need to loop somebody in on this it doesn't have to be like oh we need to have a meeting and we need to talk about this, but they need to know. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: And I think that's probably one of the biggest challenges is like knowing when I should be um um informing them, bringing them up to speed. 00:11:27 Scott Baker: And it's almost like it'd be cool like if you were working, you just had some trigger that says, "Hey, you know what? Somebody else is working on this thing or Shy Goodarzi: H. Scott Baker: this affects this person or this team. You really just need to loop them in." And and again, doesn't have to be a meeting, but it'd be really cool if I just had a quick way to think, oh, okay, I'm thinking about tweaking this experience. Oh, that's going to impact how grow is thinking about the solution seeker profile and what they want them to do. You need to like drop a note to so and so to let them know Shy Goodarzi: Wow. Wouldn't it be super cool if it just did it anyway? If Scott Baker: if Shy Goodarzi: it knew Scott Baker: it Shy Goodarzi: it. Scott Baker: just did it for you anyway. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: Yeah. like like Shy Goodarzi: thing. Scott Baker: um because because you know because what I do find is that you do have to like you know intentionally like set check-ins with folks. 00:12:15 Scott Baker: Hey, let's just check in and see you know because and you come back it's oh my god that's evolved so much since we last talked. I didn't realize you just took that direction like oh studios I didn't know that you had an idea for this and then scrapped it. Had I known that I would have said change it to this because that would work. Shy Goodarzi: Totally. Scott Baker: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Yeah. That visibility is hard. Scott Baker: It's really hard. Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. Scott Baker: Yeah. Oh, you know, because another example of of that is um you know, all this configuration work

and all this language that they're trying to do. And and there's whole thing around we're going to call them structured. It's structured learning. And then it becomes a meeting and it becomes a thing and it becomes an initiative and I'm like no I don't want to call it structured learning Shy Goodarzi: Yes. I'm glad you said that though. Yeah, Scott Baker: but but you know it's one of those things it's like oh had you because what happens is those things become institutionalized so quickly 00:13:18 Shy Goodarzi: totally. Scott Baker: that you then you have to fight back up the hill right to be able to change Shy Goodarzi: Not. Scott Baker: it. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: So I think that's the biggest thing is this just that ongoing kind of alignment amidst Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: massive changes and and nobody does it to nobody I don't really think anybody like our company anybody ever really wants to admit anybody in fact we're probably the opposite we include too many people but at the same time things do move quickly and then you don't know and then and then you just Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: literally a week goes by and then something evolves. Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Um, can you share this is I think this is a really big problem for us. Can you share what would help Yeah. What would help solve for some of that? Maybe not all, but what would sol help solve some of it in your mind Scott Baker: Yeah. I mean, I do think that there'd have to be an input process. 00:14:09 Scott Baker: Like, you do have to say, "Okay, here's the thing we're working on." You do have to set some triggers Shy Goodarzi: parameter? Scott Baker: up front to be able to say, "Okay, you know, these are the people that should be informed. And they should it should be an if then. So if we talk talk about this then this and it should trigger it and just almost send them an update. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: And um I mean maybe that could be AI even just scanning your document. Uh and it just notices oh you're talking about this. I know so and so's gonna want to weigh in and they do it as versus them having to go through and think, oh, I need to tag somebody in to actually review this particular requirement or um um this name or this strategic change or something like that. I don't know. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Scott Baker: Just just a thought. Shy Goodarzi: it's helpful. Um, how do you Okay, this is going a little bit of a different direction, but how do you currently support the growth and development of your team members? 00:15:17 Scott Baker: It's a good question. I think it's still at least for me still evolving. Uh, one thing it, you know,

um, I try to spend like one one-on-one a month kind of talking about that. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: um versus you know when we when I kicked off with the team we just had a conversation around it like what do you want? Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: Um so try to have a little bit more of a regular conversation in it. Um the other thing we do is we kind of have like send them books to read. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: So we just have to read books together that are relevant I think to the things that we're trying to do. So that Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Scott Baker: just becomes like an ongoing conversation Shy Goodarzi: that's awesome. Scott Baker: um that we that we do. Uh yeah, and then obviously just aligning with the our our our cycle from Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: development check-ins and stuff. Shy Goodarzi: What do you find challenging about if anything what do you find challenging about managing um your direct reports whether it's performance or other things 00:16:35 Scott Baker: H I think you know it's always hard to know like you know where people are in terms of like it comes back to this whole capacity thing. Are you under? Are you over? And there's this this always things like I don't want to like feel like I'm being nos. Hey, what's your capacity? Hey, you know, what are Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: you working because because it can feel very like micromanage. You don't trust me. You don't think I'm working on enough stuff. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: Um um but you know it's hard to know because it you know you might not be del working on something together so you don't see the activity Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Scott Baker: but they're working on a lot of other things. So it's just always and I think that that's what freaks people out and that's why they want them back in the office so they can see them. Shy Goodarzi: totally. Scott Baker: So knowing that, okay, you know, I don't aspire to be that, but but so it's like you just have to get really clear on like here are the the goals and 00:17:48 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: and Shy Goodarzi: The outcomes. Scott Baker: results and stuff, Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: but at the same time, right, you need to still be able to like give tasks and everything and you don't know, am I giving you this and you're are you over capacity? Is this Shy Goodarzi: Right. Scott Baker: too much? Shy Goodarzi: Right. Scott Baker: So that's like I haven't figured that out yet. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Okay. Scott Baker: Have you? Shy Goodarzi: Absolutely not. Scott Baker: Okay. Shy Goodarzi: Although I think like I think I've like tried to really build a relationship with Anastasia Scott Baker: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi:

where like she she and I see like every week we look through our pri she sees my priorities and I like copy paste to Brian. So like Brian and Oasis see the same thing and we all kind of know what each other's working on Scott Baker: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: and there's like an open door policy of like it is the individual's responsibility to tell the man tell the manager I can't take anymore like I Scott Baker: Yeah, 00:18:43 Shy Goodarzi: I am at capacity I can't do X or like if there's a world in which they have capacity to vocalize that as well. Scott Baker: that's a good that's a good norm. Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. because Scott Baker: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: there's no way you can know. And you don't want to be a helicopter of like, are you at capacity? What's going on? Scott Baker: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's a really good point. Shy Goodarzi: I'm curious how you track like your team's performance. Like when you think about seeing growth and development, like what are you looking at and how do you get that data and what does that process look like? Scott Baker: It's a good question. It's it's like a big part of what we're trying to do now is like what are our team metrics? Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: So we're we're trying to build that. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: Um we have some like initial like guidelines but you know so so we're thinking about at the team level like what are the big things that we want to track. 00:19:44 Scott Baker: Um we're not there yet but we're working on it. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: So um at the individual level it's different like like I I don't know. I mean, our stuff is so interdependent that it's hard to say. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: Um, other than like making sure that we're keeping our commitments. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: I mean, that's one of the biggest ones. Like we're we're keeping our commitments Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: and and you know, these are the things we're going to work on. having it assigned an owner and a a timeline so that those things get done. Yeah, that's what I would say. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. I'm curious, is there any data or insights or reporting that you feel would help you be a better manager? Scott Baker: I mean, there always are things, right? I'm trying to think of things that are are different than like, oh, you know, you could do a 360 and get feedback. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: Um, I think it's so difficult, especially in a virtual world, to get feedback from like peer group. 00:21:36 Scott Baker: It's just so hard, right? I mean, they can give you feedback on like maybe like one or two areas, but I it's just

awful when you get like, you know, 50 questions and like it's so difficult to be able Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: to really give good meaningful feedback. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: So, I think the thing that would could potentially help me help the most are really flow of work things. So, you know, like as you're as you're um if it's like listening to a team call and then giving you feedback afterwards and say, "Hey, you know, I wasn't really clear like what you expected people to do from Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: there. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: should really think about like being a little bit more specific or or you know you could even like before the meeting be able to set your intention. It's like oh here's what my intention for this meeting is. So it gives them gives that a little bit of a guidance to be able to give you feedback to see if you achieved your intention or not. 00:22:38 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: So if the intention is like, hey, I want to make this a meeting to kind of celebrate uh what we've done, you know, afterwards say, did that happen? Like, so I think something like that would be helpful in a couple reasons. One, it would be like it's helpful just in terms of like you getting like putting you in the right mindset to be able to do, but then also giving you feedback as to whether or not you reached your goal. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: And I feel like that would be more useful than than just like um like I was listening I was doing a call with Disney and uh we were meeting with Liz and she was giving us all this feedback on one of the plans and she's like oh no my AI coach I guess co-pilot was chiming in saying you're talking too much and you're not asking enough questions. Shy Goodarzi: Whoa. Scott Baker: And I'm like oh that's interesting. And I asked her, "Was that co-pilot?" And she says, "Yeah, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. 00:23:33 Scott Baker: that's it. You're not taking turns." The the coach said, and I thought, "Okay, that's interesting." But she's like, "Oh, no." She said, "You're talking too fast." That's Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Scott Baker: what the the co-pilot said. And you're not taking turns and asking questions. That that was the feedback it gave her in the flow. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Scott Baker: and and you know my reaction was thank you for talking fast and moving through this because you've got a lot of feedback you need to give it to us. Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Scott Baker: So it completely missed the Shy Goodarzi: The like context of what you were trying to Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Scott Baker: So to me it was like okay this thing is a nuisance I'm not going to listen

to it because Shy Goodarzi: Totally. Scott Baker: it's did not so so I think those kind of tools are only useful if like if I say oh here's what the intent is here's what I want to try to accomplish and then it might say yeah you are you're not asking any questions that's a 00:24:29 Shy Goodarzi: Right. And that like that's a really interesting about interesting thing about tooling is like I think it is really a lot of friction for managers to think that they have to give an input first. It's like, Scott Baker: Yeah, Shy Goodarzi: and that is a thing that I think you have to get right and have to make it seamless enough that they're willing to give you that information to make it relevant because Scott Baker: exactly. Shy Goodarzi: otherwise Yeah. Scott Baker: It's not relevant. Or Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: it could be, you know, it could be you don't say anything Shy Goodarzi: Right. Scott Baker: and it's like, why aren't you saying anything? It's like, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: well, no, that's not my it's not my goal here. Shy Goodarzi: Yes. That's a really good point. Scott Baker: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Okay, we have four minutes left. One Scott Baker: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: of the final questions for you is if you were to create a tool for managers or even a suite of tools, whatever you want, what would it help or what would they help you do? 00:25:43 Scott Baker: I mean, I think one thing is that that I mean, I really would like something that just took the effort out of like thinking, okay, Once a month I need to do a uh hey let's review our priorities meeting Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: uh with the team. Uh once a month I should have like a quick development conversation once a you know because there's like so many like disperate things that aren't necessarily routinized that it it takes effort and intention to do it and if you don't think about it and plan it and schedule everything it's Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Scott Baker: just hard. Shy Goodarzi: totally. Scott Baker: So, you know, just like I would love to set up manage to where you come into manage and then you plan out your year. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: Here's what my development should look like for this year. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: I want to dedicate this block here and this block here and in between I'll do these things and then it just takes over and does it for me. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: Similarly, I I I would love like um okay um you know it just can't be completely generated. 00:26:51 Scott Baker: it would need to interview me and collect some inputs Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Scott Baker: and then say look here's how I think you should structure your

interactions with the team and then it knows a little bit about what it is and what you should be doing and they Shy Goodarzi: we're Scott Baker: can even Shy Goodarzi: trying Scott Baker: give Shy Goodarzi: to Scott Baker: you Shy Goodarzi: do Scott Baker: feedback on how those Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: go Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: and and could suggest hey look yeah lot of stuff going on I think you should once a week do this x y and z here's a tool that helps with that and you know in your one-on- ones you should do this xyz and then take the kind of like oh s*** I need to put this on the calendar like I put little notes each month do this. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Scott Baker: Each week you want to do this. So to me that would be I think helpful. Shy Goodarzi: really helpful. Scott Baker: Um and it has to be seamless in the flow of work. 00:27:33 Scott Baker: So then boom, like when I had that one-on-one that month, it would just automatically prompt me with the questions that I needed to to ask during Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: that time versus me having to like think about it or, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: you know, that one team meeting it would just prompt me and say, "Hey, you know, do these things." Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Scott Baker: Um, so that's one thing. The the the next thing would be I mean it just all comes back to this alignment thing like Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Scott Baker: how How do we stay aligned? How do we stay aligned? And I don't know what that tool looks like. And none of these things work. I think all these you have to feed with some inputs Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: to be honest. Like Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. It's not. Yeah. Scott Baker: it's just not like it just just can't show up and start working. Just like Shy Goodarzi: No. Scott Baker: you can't write a prompt without giving it a little bit 00:28:54 Shy Goodarzi: Exactly. Scott Baker: of content. Shy Goodarzi: That's Scott Baker: just doesn't Shy Goodarzi: why. Exactly. Scott Baker: so you know it's this whole notion of like and it shows it in all the strategy literature is everybody rolls out the goals and here's the things that we're going to work on we can say here are trees plants and seeds this is our process of release everybody they got it yeah I got it got it and then you go and interview people Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: and Shy Goodarzi: They Scott Baker: they Shy Goodarzi: don't Scott Baker: can't Shy Goodarzi: got it. Scott Baker: they don't got it they can do one thing they Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: maybe Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: right and that's Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker:

It's crazy like how it doesn't go. So, there's got to be something like like a way a playful way to kind of like just make sure people are aligned around the top Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Scott Baker: things. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Or even telling you like, hey, how much like is this coming up in conversations? Is this thing like are people talking about the thing that I said we should be focused on? Or just like can I get some signal that this thing that I communicated is actually people are hearing it? Scott Baker: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. Scott Baker: Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, Shy Goodarzi: Well, Scott, thank you. This was super super helpful, wonderful ideas and a lot of overlap with what many other managers have shared. Scott Baker: that's good. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, I think there's some really great themes and Scott Baker: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: then there are some like one-offs that feel specific to an org, a function or whatever, but that's also really helpful information. Scott Baker: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: I'll synthesize this all aggregate it. So no one's not personal at all and I'll share that out soon enough. Scott Baker: Oh cool. Yay. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Thank Scott Baker: It's good Shy Goodarzi: you. Scott Baker: as always, alright? Okay. Transcription ended after 00:30:42 This editable transcript was computer generated and might contain errors.

To address these challenges, Keaton Price described utilizing AI for coaching and expressed a desire for increased executive representation for design, a tool to filter low-value Slack usage, and a more frequent feedback mechanism. Shy Goodarzi acknowledged these points, noting their relevance to team enablement tools. Details Initial Remarks and Role Description Keaton Price expressed openness to sharing, noting their small team of two designers. Shy Goodarzi assured Keaton Price of confidentiality regarding other managers' input. Keaton Price described their current hybrid role as a principal designer managing a team of two, responsible for UX research and interaction design across all apps. Keaton Price has a total of seven or eight years of management experience, not continuous. Comparison of Management Experiences Keaton Price noted that BetterUp has significantly more manager training and expectations compared to previous organizations. In prior roles, management focused more on guiding the work itself, whereas at BetterUp, it emphasizes thought leadership and guiding the perception of work (). Top Management Challenges Keaton Price identified very limited resources, including headcount, as a primary challenge, hindering their team's ability to achieve goals. Effectively growing AI adoption within the team in a uniform way is another challenge. Additionally, coaching is currently difficult due to limited capacity, requiring

significant time and reflection (). Addressing Resource Limitations and Coaching Culture Keaton Price believes that increased executive representation for the design function would help alleviate resource issues and earlier involvement in roadmap planning. To save time in coaching, Keaton Price utilizes AI with ChatGPT threads for each direct report, incorporating context from career chats and impact documentation (). This process involves a panelist prompt approach using personas like Bren√© Brown, Simon Sinek, and Adam Grant to generate coaching insights and bullet points (). Keaton Price finds this AI-assisted coaching process to be significantly impactful, helping with thought processing and providing diverse feedback (). Challenges in Team Performance and Low-Value Activities Keaton Price finds it hard to organically encourage designers to share their work with each other and cross-functionally (). Keaton Price feels that a significant portion, around 90%, of Slack usage is low value, contributing to bad habits. Time spent preparing for demos that do not materialize and working on initiatives that are already being addressed or lack demand are also considered low value (). The lack of clear processes for Slack usage leads to project ballooning with multiple channels and private threads (). Keaton Price desires a tool using a large language model to filter Slack and prioritize their time effectively (). Issues with Processes and Communication Hurdles Keaton Price noted that while processes exist for demos, they frequently change, and ownership shifts, leading to wasted effort. There's a tendency to be reactive and a lack of clarity on when to involve non-go-to-market personnel in deals (). Keaton Price faces the challenge of keeping their team informed without overwhelming them with constant changes and jargon (). Across teams, Keaton Price's limited time due to IC and other responsibilities makes proactive communication difficult (). Prioritization Strategy Keaton Price prioritizes tasks by aligning them with their personal mission of designing spaces where people can become their best selves (). They also utilize BetterUp's prioritization framework, focusing on initiatives that address high-level trees, plant seeds, and R&D priorities (). Keaton Price finds the shift to three releases has made prioritization trickier due to the less clear alignment with roadmap items (). Administrative Burden and Time Management Keaton Price identified the need for a design operations manager to alleviate administrative tasks such as Figma role provisioning (). Keaton Price currently handles these tasks as they arise, which can be disruptive (). Keaton Price described their ideal weekly planning process, which involves mapping out all tasks on Monday morning and assigning the hardest task ("eating the frog") to each day to build momentum (). Team Growth and Development Support Keaton Price conducts career chats with their team members every one to two months. They also lead workshops using a bullseye framework to identify strengths and areas for improvement in hard and soft skills (). This collaborative process helps establish three to five focus skills for each individual (). Desire for Improved Feedback Mechanisms Keaton Price expressed a need for more frequent 360 feedback, noting

the inadequacy of the current Workday process (). Keaton Price recalled developing a lightweight Slack app called Speedback for real-time feedback, which is no longer available (). Keaton Price desires a continuous, lightweight feedback system not tied to performance review cycles to avoid bias and ensure honest input (). Thoughts on a Manager Tool Keaton Price envisions a manager dashboard that aggregates data from work tools and 360 feedback to identify team members who may be struggling or need support. However, Keaton Price is wary of such tools becoming overly intrusive or creating a surveillance-like environment, referencing concerns raised by tools like Palantir (). While desiring the benefits of such a tool, Keaton Price has reservations about its potential negative impacts and the "redder ocean" of similar tools it might create (). Keaton Price believes that such a tool might be more acceptable at an aggregate level rather than for individual monitoring, especially for small teams (). Shy Goodarzi mentioned that this discussion would inform team enablement tools like copilot (). Suggested next steps No suggested next steps were found for this meeting.

Keaton Price: my name's on it, it's probably going to be pretty obvious. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Yes. Um, there are a few other managers who felt the same way and like I am not going to share any of the train like this is just a me thing and like I'm committed to that. So, Keaton Price: Sounds good. Shy Goodarzi: okay. Uh, can you describe your current role and what your team is responsible for? Keaton Price: Sure. Um, so my current role is a hybrid IC management role. Um, so I'm acting as a principal designer and also managing a team of two designers and we are responsible for uh UX research and interaction design across all of our apps layer. Shy Goodarzi: Incredible. How long have you been in a management role, including outside of Better Up? Keaton Price: um not continuous but I started managing I think in total somewhere around seven or eight years Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: but with breaks in between 00:01:01 Shy Goodarzi: Totally. Uh, and it sounds like you already answered how many people do you manage and it I'm confirming, but do you manage individual contributors or managers or both? Keaton Price: I manage two IC's Shy Goodarzi: Cool. And it sounds like you have managed in other organizations before. How does this current experience compare? Keaton Price: um compare um as in like how are they similar only? Shy Goodarzi: How are they similar? Are they different? Is there Keaton Price: Okay. Shy Goodarzi: anything that feels like specific to Better Up or or Keaton Price: Yeah. Yeah. Um there's certainly a lot more manager training and manager expectation at

BetterUp compared to previous organizations I've been in. Um management at previous organizations and it could also be just a difference in my seniority, but it was much more about guiding the work. And I find at betterup it's a lot more about thought leadership and how you guide the perceptions of the work than maybe the work itself Shy Goodarzi: Interesting. It's super helpful. Okay, taking a step back, what are the top two to three challenges you face as a manager right now? 00:02:18 Keaton Price: very limited resources and that includes headcount. So we have not enough resources to actually accomplish the goals we have. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Keaton Price: Um effectively growing AI adoption within the team is is a challenge. Um especially like trying to do that in a way that is somewhat uniform. So like yesterday I hosted a vibe coding session for the whole design team where we just vibe coded together to learn hey how can we prototype with this. Shy Goodarzi: It's Keaton Price: Um Shy Goodarzi: cool. Keaton Price: also coaching is very difficult right now. Um and again that that goes back to capacity. Uh so like had to have another difficult coaching conversation yesterday. um those take a lot of time to like do them well and really reflect and lead those in a way that's constructive. Um so yeah, resources, AI adoption and creating like a a coaching culture. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Um, I have some follow-up questions about that. So, the first one around capacity, resourcing, Keaton Price: Yep. Shy Goodarzi: etc. Um, is there anything uh that you think would be like that would help alleviate the solution or the issue, sorry, the problem other than more resources. 00:03:37 Keaton Price: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That um one thing that would for sure alleviate the issue is having more executive representation for the design function. When we when we lost our uh design VP um we lost a lot not just on the administrative and leadership side but design is brought in too late on those roadmap issues. So, it's a compounding problem where we don't have the resources, but we're also not involved in the planning for new initiatives, which creates a flywheel of not having enough. Shy Goodarzi: totally. Um, I want to touch on the third piece around this coaching culture and like it takes a lot of time. Can you think of anything that might be helpful to you in that process um to save yourself time? Keaton Price: Well, AI is very helpful. That's how I try to do more with glass here. So my process with that is um I have career chats with all my direct reports. So I have documentation on their hard skills and soft skills and Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: I keep impact uh Google docs of all of the work that they've done successfully. 00:04:46 Keaton Price: And then I have a chat GPT

thread for each direct report that has all of that context. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: So when I need to coach them, I can just go into advanced voice mode, word vomit a bit, and then I um take a panelist prompt approach where I create a panel of usually Bnee Brown, uh Simon Synynic, and Adam Grant because they're Rene's going to be very like vulnerability focused, Simon's very why focused, and Adam Grant is very like metrics focused and they balance each other out. And so I word vomit to them like here's the situation and I ask them to coach me on how to coach the direct report and then I will role play and then I'll have it spit out bullet points. Here's what you need to talk about Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Keaton Price: and I can typically get that done in like 15 to 20 minutes. Shy Goodarzi: Wow. That's super super cool. Keaton Price: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Oh my god. Um, and how have you how has that like impacted your like the coaching that you are able to give to your director reports? 00:05:45 Keaton Price: Oh, it's huge. Um, it helps me process my thoughts which helps me move from like emotional reactive thinking to the right kind of thinking. Um, it gives me feedback from luminaries and it helps me role play. So I show up to the room knowing more of how I need to show up if Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Keaton Price: makes sense. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Wow. That's very cool. Um, okay. Are there particular areas of your team's performance or development that you find hardest to influence? Keaton Price: Yes. Um, one in particular that it feels like a hill that I wanted to die on and I might have died on it, which is uh uh getting designers to organically share their own work. Shy Goodarzi: H. Keaton Price: And that's for two like with each other. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: Uh, and that's for two reasons. One is as as a design team we need to be aware of each other's work and I believe that the design only spaces should be safe spaces Shy Goodarzi: Is that 00:06:55 Keaton Price: and that helps us share context and we all get a picture of like the whole elephant. Uh but two it's a practice space because our design team also isn't great at sharing work crossf functionally and Shy Goodarzi: No. Keaton Price: it feels like pulling teeth to get that done. So, um, yeah, like creating a culture where designers don't need constant process and nagging to share their work. Shy Goodarzi: Wow, I'm aligned. Um, shouldn't be saying that, but yes, I understand. Okay. What do you spend time on that or do you spend any any time on things that you feel are low value? Keaton Price: Oh yeah. Um I feel like 90% of Slack is pretty low value.

Um which is bad because it forms bad habits and then I'm like more willing to ignore it because it's just you get sucked in. Um I uh like like sales stuff recently has been pretty low value. It's like spending a lot of time preparing for um demos that haven't happened or haven't converted. Shy Goodarzi: Can you tell me a 00:08:21 Keaton Price: Uh Shy Goodarzi: little Keaton Price: yeah. Shy Goodarzi: um Keaton Price: Yeah. Go ahead. Shy Goodarzi: keep going and then I'll ask I'll I'll ask a followup Keaton Price: Okay. Shy Goodarzi: question. Keaton Price: Yeah. The other thing is just it's not like a particular theme like the previous two, but um there is a pattern of trying to buy us toward action and working on something only to realize like other people are working on it or that there isn't a desire for that work. And so then it turns out that that was pretty low value. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Yeah. Okay. There's I want to dig in here first on the Slack communications. Can you tell me a little bit more about what feels low value? You were just like Slack in general. Can you Keaton Price: Yep. Shy Goodarzi: tell me a little more concretely like what about it feels low value? Keaton Price: We don't have um there's a few things. We don't have clear processes for how and when to use Slack. 00:09:10 Shy Goodarzi: Cut. Keaton Price: So projects tend to balloon and then there's like five different Slack channels per project that have slightly different audiences. At the same time, we have a culture where people are scared to post in public channels and tend to create oneoff DM threads. So then usually you've got four or five channels and then four or five separate threads with the same groups of people. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Keaton Price: Um, and that's just for project work. Beyond that, I think there's also a problem where Slack was a really disruptive awesome change. Uh, and it got us away from email, but it has a critical mass problem where it's really great on small teams, but um, we're not a huge company, but even for our company, like Shy Goodarzi: Does it scale? Keaton Price: there's just so much signal. Shy Goodarzi: Totally. Keaton Price: It's like so much noise, Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Keaton Price: not enough signal. Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Keaton Price: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Um, what would be is there anything that you could see helping you navigate that challenge? Keaton Price: Yes. I've tried to build it. 00:10:09 Keaton Price: Uh, well, we had it. It was glean. Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Keaton Price: I need a tool that uses a large language model to sift through all of it and tell me, "Hey, you've got 20 minutes between meetings. Here's how to most effectively use your time. And by the way, I've already looked at your

how you write and I've drafted messages to all of these." And you can just send them. I need that tool like like yesterday. Shy Goodarzi: I love that idea. um to the point of having trouble. Okay, where do we say I'm sorry? You said Slack communication. You said I'm forgetting the other two and I should Keaton Price: Uh, one one was just uh working on things that ended up Shy Goodarzi: demo. Keaton Price: not being wanted and then demos. Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Keaton Price: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Can you share and actually it might be similar to that but like could you share like thoughts on it? What would help you again navigate those particular challenges? 00:11:08 Keaton Price: Yeah. Um, on the demo side I I mean my gut says process, but I do feel like we we've implemented process. It's more sticking with a process. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: uh the process seems to change quite a bit Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Keaton Price: and the owners seem to change quite a bit. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Keaton Price: Um which just compounds like the problem of spending time on something that has a very short shelf life. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Keaton Price: Um it we tend to have a very reactive footing and then we also don't have a clear guide for maturity or scale of a deal and when to pull in people who are not in the go to market function. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Keaton Price: So what that means is like we've created a culture where the squeaky wheel gets the resources and it leads to a lot of squeaky wheels. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yes. Okay. I'm going to move us on the interest Keaton Price: Okay. Shy Goodarzi: of time. Um, what are the biggest communication hurdles you face with your team or other teams? 00:12:20 Keaton Price: Um, there's a bal with my team. It's a balance of I try to keep them as informed as possible without it feeling like a fire hose or that I'm constantly in a reactive place Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: because there's so much changing and happening all the time and there's so many new buzzwords and projects and like um Hogue names and squads and design sprints u that it can be overwhelming. And so I try to heir on the side of giving my team all of the information they need to do their jobs. But there's a trade-off there because if you give them everything, it just feels like it's a new week and everything's changed again, which is difficult. And I don't want them to feel like demoralized. And Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: I also don't want them to feel like they're drinking from a fire hose every week. Shy Goodarzi: Absolutely. Keaton Price: So like what's the right cadence there? That's a huge challenge. um across teams. It's finding the balance in um I am

I don't have the luxury of just like just being a manager or a director. 00:13:28 Keaton Price: I need to be that plus an IC plus hire plus Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: you go to market stuff. So, um, my free time or my time when I'm not in meetings tends Shy Goodarzi: Totally. Keaton Price: to go toward those other tasks. Whereas, if I was just managing, I could spend more time involving myself in other groups and other Slack channels and finding patterns, which would help us communicate more proactively. But since I don't have that time, I find myself being much more reactive, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Keaton Price: which I don't like. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Can you tell me how you currently prioritize your own time? Keaton Price: Yeah, sure. Um, so I there's like the top of how I do that and then there's how it trickles down. So, um, I found several years ago that the best way for me to sustain any sense of like motivation is to tie all of the everything I do to my personal mission. So my personal mission is to design and create spaces where people find and become the best versions of themselves. 00:14:35 Keaton Price: And sometimes those spaces are digital like at betterup. Sometimes they're physical like an interior design. Sometimes it's how I show up with my family. But everything I do has to go through that that mission. If it's outside of that, I try to just get rid of it. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: Um and then so that's how I frame work for myself. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: uh work is one of those spaces and those spaces are the literal spaces we design and the spaces I design for the team. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: Um and so that's like the first thing is if it doesn't fit in into that I try to cut it which as a manager sucks because a lot of the things you have to do are just administrative and just don't don't fit that. Um outside of that what I do is I use whatever priority and strategy framework I have available. So at betterup that is high level trees plant seeds and then our R&D function uh what our priorities are for the year. 00:15:30 Keaton Price: Um and I tend to use that as my like prioritization rubric. Basically if it's addressing those in in order that's how I'll prioritize my time Shy Goodarzi: Got it. Keaton Price: and my team's time. Um if it's not it's probably going to get cut. What I will say though is the shift to the three releases has been tricky because while the road map is clear, we get a lot of requests that are not onetoone with road map items and the new three releases are just fuzzy enough where now it's hard to say is Shy Goodarzi: That Keaton

Price: that AI Shy Goodarzi: doesn't Keaton Price: for all? It Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Keaton Price: could be Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Keaton Price: like you know what I mean? You kind of have to like tell a story. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like not clear. You can't like clearly delineate Keaton Price: Right. Shy Goodarzi: like Yeah. Keaton Price: I used to have like dare to lead plus manage clear. Okay, now I know, right? 00:16:21 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Um, there's two follow-up questions. One is around you talked about admin, like sometimes just being part of being a manager is like admin. Can you tell me more about that and if there's anything that you can think of that could help you kind of alleviate that work or like minimize Keaton Price: Oh Shy Goodarzi: it? Keaton Price: yeah. Uh well, a design operations manager. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Keaton Price: That's huge. we um have submitted for that for headcount. We haven't been able to get it approved but um at scale on a design or that's typically what you would have. So like for example across the entire organization everyone who needs a Figma role Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: and submits it through infosc I have to go in take that infosc ticket provision it in Figma Shy Goodarzi: Oh my Keaton Price: go Shy Goodarzi: god. Keaton Price: back to the infosc system say I did it. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Keaton Price: Um, and that's on top of just like general management things like managing time off and um, you know, managing uh, uh, expenses and just, you know, like all like the the little stuff that that piles up. 00:17:23 Keaton Price: Um, automating some of that would be really really helpful. Shy Goodarzi: Totally. And do you currently like um those Yeah. feel like administrative tasks, do you like schedule time on your calendar to do it? Like how do you go about actually getting that work done? Keaton Price: I should schedule more time for that specifically, but right now what I do basically is just handle it when it comes in. Um, uh, which can be kind of disruptive, but it's just each of these tasks only takes like 5 to 10 minutes. So that's Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Keaton Price: enough for me to convince myself that like I can just do it in a meeting or I can just do it in between meetings. Shy Goodarzi: Yep. Okay. Um, yeah. Tell me a little bit more about how you like you work like day to day or week to week. How do you plan your week? How do you know what you're going to be doing? Do you do that? Keaton Price: Yeah. Well, so um it's it's evolved and it continues to change. 00:18:22 Keaton Price: um how I like to plan my weeks and how I've been most successful like at the times in

my career when I am peak performance um which I would not say I I am in right now. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: How I like to do that is Monday morning I start the day by planning out my week and I map out everything that needs to get done Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: across all the work streams and then I assign um a well a frog to each day. So, are you familiar with the phrase eat eat the frog? Shy Goodarzi: No. Keaton Price: Uh, I forget who who it was. Maybe Mark Twain, but everyone attributes Mark Twain to all Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Keaton Price: kinds of quotes. Um, the quote the paraphrase quote is like if you have to eat a frog, it's best to do it in the morning because then the rest of your day is easy. And the idea is like do the hardest thing first. Don't Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Keaton Price: push it out. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. 00:19:13 Keaton Price: And so what I and when I'm when I've had those peak performance moments that what I do is I for each day when I plan out my my my all the stuff I have to get done, I pick the hardest task and I assign one to each day and Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: I tell myself do that first before you do anything else before you Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: catch up on Slack, whatever. Eat the frog. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: And um it's a good way to like build momentum but also like get that hint of dopamine and realize like you already did the hardest thing for the day. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. You've accomplished something. Yeah. Keaton Price: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: I really like that. Um, I'm curious, we're going to move to a slightly different path, but I'm curious, is there any data or insights that you Well, actually, no, let me take a step back. There are a couple of first questions I need to ask. How do you currently support the growth and development of your team members? 00:20:06 Keaton Price: Yeah. Um so uh we do career chats typically like either every month or every other month. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: Um and these build on each other. There are also a series of workshops that I lead for anyone that I manage. So um I think you've seen one. It's um basically like a bullseye concentric circle framework. And Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: in the middle are the things you're the best at and on the outside the things that you need the most improvement on. And then we have hard skills and soft skills. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Keaton Price: And so the workshop is run just like a design workshop. I ask um the direct report to make their own bullseye. So drag all those hard and soft skills to where you

think they are. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: I do the same. I put them where I think they are. And Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: then we just bring them together and we compare Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Keaton Price: and we say what's standing out. 00:20:54 Keaton Price: And from that we pick um three to five at the most skills that that person should focus on and that becomes the goal. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: And then we revisit that come like touch point time. Shy Goodarzi: Okay, I like that a lot. That's super cool. I think I've seen one of yours and that's it's like it's a very cool way to do it. Um, is there anything is there any data or there any insights that you wish you had in to help support you as a manager? Keaton Price: Yes. Um more 360 feedback would be great. our process of Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: using workday for 360 feedback is pretty bad. And I think you can you can tell that because a lot of senior leaders at the company don't even use it, right? Like our SVP of product has a really great homemade Google form and thing, right? Like um yeah, so getting 360 feedback is like pulling teeth here and I get it. everyone's super busy, no one goes to work day. 00:22:01 Keaton Price: Totally understand it. But more 360 feedback would be really helpful because then it's not just this person's self assessment or how I see this person. It's, hey, here's how the people you're working with are reacting Shy Goodarzi: you 100%. Can you tell me about how you like when would you want that feedback and how often would you want it? Keaton Price: continually. I would like that to not be um so I way back in 2013 2014 something like that Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: um when Slack first launched their like app store their Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: whatever they call it um I was at a startup that was uh failing and we only had a little bit of money left and we were just like testing all kinds of ideas and we in a week built One of the first Slack apps, it was called Speedback. And the idea was, could you make 360 feedback so lightweight that people could just do it in a minute in Slack? Shy Goodarzi: Wow, Keaton Price: Um, we Shy Goodarzi: that's Keaton Price: ran out of money and it's it's no longer around. 00:23:05 Keaton Price: But I want that I want I want it to be so lightweight that it's continual and it's not tied to like a performance review cadence where managers Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Keaton Price: have to sit there for an entire day filling out 360 feedback for everyone they've worked with. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Keaton Price: Totally. Shy Goodarzi: Not just that, there's like recency bias

and like how like it's a point in time, right? Keaton Price: And Shy Goodarzi: Um Keaton Price: if it's performance review time, I think there's also bias in like uh well, this is tied to this person's performance for the year, which is going to impact their their raise, so I should probably air on the side of positivity maybe, Shy Goodarzi: yes, Keaton Price: right? Just like I want honest continual pulses. Shy Goodarzi: feedback. Yeah, I love that. With just a few minutes left, I want to Keaton Price: Imagine Shy Goodarzi: ask you uh a very open-ended question. If you were to design a tool for managers, what would it help you do? Keaton Price: that. Sorry. 00:23:55 Shy Goodarzi: How meta is this conversation? Keaton Price: Um, if I were to design a tool for managers, what would it help me do as a manager? It's tricky because there's what I want and then there's why I don't want it. Um, so, um, you know, I I think about like the the mocks that we showed at Uplift for where we're going with like a manager dashboard Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: and being able to pull in data from flow of work tools like, you know, Google Docs, Slack, Teams, email, whatever. Um, and then there's, you know, whole person data, 360 feedback. I would love to have a dashboard that takes all of that and and gives me a sense of, okay, this person might be struggling or this Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Keaton Price: person needs some help. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Keaton Price: But I've seen tools like that go wrong enough times where Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Keaton Price: it becomes big brothery. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Keaton Price: Um, you know, I I I think about like we use the the Palunteer example quite a bit. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. 00:25:15 Keaton Price: Um, I think the tools they've they've made, you can make an argument that they've made the world safer, but they've certainly introduced a surveillance state and there's certainly a lot of objective bad that's that's come to the world because of tools like that. And so it varies a lot by like who the person is that's using it. And so I want that tool, but I don't want that tool to be live in the world. Shy Goodarzi: Interesting. Keaton Price: That That's a really weird answer, but Shy Goodarzi: No, Keaton Price: does that make sense? Shy Goodarzi: it makes a lot of sense. Do you feel like that there is a world in which like parts of this or like a like something that could be incredibly helpful can exist without the negative impact or just or or the other possibilities. It's just not possible. Keaton Price: Of course. Of course. Of course. Um, I mean it's some extent it's all like once the genie is out of the bottle, it's out of the bottle. And 00:26:15

Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Keaton Price: so regardless of like how well we make the tool, you're Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Keaton Price: going to introduce a redder ocean if it's successful and then people are going to make that tool a bit differently. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Keaton Price: Um, so maybe it's inevitable to some extent and maybe this is just like where the world is going. Um, I do think there's hope in keeping a tool like that at the aggregate. Shy Goodarzi: Yep. Of course. Of course. Keaton Price: So like you're looking at populations of people. Once you get to individuals, that's where it starts to feel very weird. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Keaton Price: As a manager of a small team, there's no way I could get an aggregate Shy Goodarzi: Like Keaton Price: of Shy Goodarzi: totally Keaton Price: like two people. Shy Goodarzi: totally. Well, Katon, this was lovely and wonderful and so much good information. Thank you for spending time with me. Thank you Keaton Price: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: for sharing your thoughts. This will all be like anonymous aggregated. 00:27:06 Shy Goodarzi: Um, but there's some definite themes that I'm Keaton Price: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: sensing. So, I'm really excited to kind of aggre use AI to to aggregate this pretty quickly to to turn this around and share with everyone, but also Keaton Price: Love Shy Goodarzi: for Keaton Price: it. Shy Goodarzi: our for our work. Um, Keaton Price: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: and Keaton Price: I Shy Goodarzi: this Keaton Price: love Shy Goodarzi: is Keaton Price: it. Shy Goodarzi: really meant to be not just in support of manager involvement and feedback, which I think it can be good input there. It's also for team enablement tools. So, when we think about copilot and like what tooling will actually be critical for managers going forward, that's something I'm starting to think about. Keaton Price: Yeah, and I'm super biased for obvious reasons. Um, but yeah, that that's awesome. Um, and I look forward to my Amazon gift card. Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Yep. But thank you for your time. I'll Keaton Price: Thank you. Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: see you soon. Keaton Price: Awesome. Transcription ended after 00:27:57 This editable transcript was computer generated and might contain errors.

To prioritize, Zander Grant aligns with their manager's expectations and uses various tools for organization, identifying calendar coordination and information sourcing as low-value activities. Zander Grant values managerial connections for shared learning and sees information silos as a communication hurdle, while emphasizing continuous development conversations with their team member and expressing interest in data on time allocation and tools

for better workflow understanding, referencing a positive experience with 15Five. Shy Goodarzi is collecting input for developing managerial support tools. Details Current Role and Responsibilities Zander Grant is the director of strategic initiatives, currently focused on the Bnee Brown partnership. Their team is responsible for building a network of coaches and facilitators to support new products and services. Management Experience Zander Grant has been in management roles for approximately ten years, including time outside of Eter. In their current role, they manage one individual contributor, while their previous role as director of customer support operations involved managing four reports, including a manager. Current Managerial Challenges Zander Grant identified resourcing as a significant challenge due to the rapidly moving business and the need to demonstrate a return on investment for additional resources. They also find it challenging to balance their managerial responsibilities with the demands of building and doing the work required in their function (). Strategies for Prioritization Zander Grant prioritizes their time by aligning with their manager's expectations and envisioning the narrative they want to present at the end of a reporting period, working backward to guide their daily decisions (). They use tools like Chat GPT, Slack for reminders, thorough documentation, and a detailed calendar to stay organized and focused on their goals (). Low-Value Activities Zander Grant finds coordinating calendars and tracking down the source of truth to be the most time-consuming activities that yield low value (). The difficulty in scheduling arises from visibility issues in internal calendars and the added complexity of coordinating with external parties like the Bnee Brown team (). Importance of Managerial Connection Zander Grant highlighted the value of conversations among managers, noting that sharing challenges and solutions can be very helpful for day-to-day work and can provide a sense of shared experience and actionable takeaways (). They believe that greater awareness of different departments' work could lead to better collaboration and problem-solving (). Communication Hurdles Zander Grant perceives a silo of information across teams as a communication hurdle, making it difficult to understand what other departments are working on and how they might be interconnected (). While acknowledging a personal responsibility to network more, they find it challenging to prioritize this amidst immediate work demands (). Supporting Team Growth Zander Grant emphasizes constant, informal development conversations with their report, fostering a relationship where feedback is a regular two-way exchange rather than a formal event (). This approach helps to decouple feedback from performance evaluations and creates a more open and continuous growth environment (). Desired Data and Insights While not having a specific data point immediately in mind, Zander Grant mentioned interest in a better understanding of time allocation in meetings and overall bandwidth (). They and their report have tried various methods for tracking responsibilities and time but have not found a consistently effective solution (). Ideal Tool for Managers Zander Grant envisions a tool that provides a deeper understanding of their report's workflow, acknowledging that while their current relationship

allows for this, it requires significant time investment (). They recalled a positive experience with a previous tool (15Five) that facilitated weekly check-ins and provided visibility into team priorities and accomplishments (). Future Tool Development Shy Goodarzi is gathering insights from multiple managers to inform the development of tools aimed at supporting managers and simplifying their work (). Zander Grant offered to provide further input if any additional thoughts arise . Suggested next steps No suggested next steps were found for this meeting.

Zander Grant: Yes. Uh my current role is director of strategic initiatives and our my focus right now is the Bnee Brown partnership. Um and building out the network of coaches and facilitators to support the new products and services that we're offering via that partnership. Um and I can stop there unless Shy Goodarzi: Great. Zander Grant: you want more details. Shy Goodarzi: Well, I'll ask you. We'll we'll get to it, I'm sure. Um, how long have you been in a management role, including time outside of Eter? Zander Grant: Oh my gosh. Uh that is a great question. Um four eight 10 years. Shy Goodarzi: Wow. Zander Grant: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. And how many people do you currently manage? Zander Grant: One. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Uh, and is this person an individ individual contributor or a manager? Zander Grant: Um sorry. It's just very funny because this is also my four-year anniversary this week uh tomorrow actually and then it's like my birthday on um Mondays and then there's just a lot and this is a brand new role for me so this is a pretty funny conversation. 00:01:09 Zander Grant: Um they are an individual contributor. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. And I what I'm hoping for in this conversation is you can also leverage experiences and examples from your past role. And if Zander Grant: Great. Shy Goodarzi: we we'll just put that on the record as well. Can you share with me what your previous role was? Zander Grant: Yes. My previous role was director of customer support operations where I had four reports, one being a manager um as well as overseeing our BO which Shy Goodarzi: Awesome. Zander Grant: was is uh that BO uh which over provided us the support contractors for our support uh arm. Shy Goodarzi: And um it sounds like you have managed in other organizations before. Um can you tell me a little bit how this um either is similar or different from your past experiences? Zander Grant: Yeah. So, this role that I'm currently in is completely different because it is very than my previous roles because it is very like um specific to a a business

uh function in terms of like building out a brand new arm of the business to support a new product and service. 00:02:11 Zander Grant: Whereas in this the previous role I was in customer support operations overseeing the support department which is what I had historically done in my career. Uh at my Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Zander Grant: previous employer, I similarly oversaw a customer support operations team. Shy Goodarzi: got it. Okay, we're going to get into the fun stuff now. If we take a step back, can you tell me uh what are the top two to three challenges you face as a manager now? right now. Zander Grant: Um top two or three challenges. I would say um resourcing is probably one of the bigger ones. I think um resourcing just that we're in a quickly moving business and um resourcing can be tight and the the need to show a return on investment on any request for additional resourcing or otherwise can be difficult when it's you're very much in the thick of building. Um so that's difficult and then I would say this is something that I felt have felt um uniquely at betterup is that I feel like I have the manager and people management um requirement of my role and then completely somewhat completely separately at times it feels completely separate. 00:03:20 Zander Grant: I'm required for the building and the actual doing of the role and the function and bouncing between those is can be very challenging. Shy Goodarzi: I hear you. I hear you. Um, I want to ask how, let's start with the resourcing piece. Is there anything today that like would be helpful to you in helping to solve that challenge? And I I guess so like I would say like without just adding more resources. Zander Grant: Yeah, I think maybe like a better way to understand where my current resources are being allocated because I Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: think that often times the conversation is like well what do you what are you currently working on and where's the investment of the resources? that you currently have going um and like what is the share of time and having like that time pie for my reports or for my organization I think would be really helpful because then I'd be able to understand better well or actually overindexing in this area or we can uh make the slice of this pie a little bit smaller um and then I think that would be that's what comes to mind with that 00:04:24 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yes. And then I'll ask a similar question around the like IC like player as coach like being a manager but also an IC at the same time. Is there anything that would be helpful to you in navigating that? Zander Grant: That is a good question. Um I think that any anything that lessens the burden on either side

of that I think would be of course helpful. I think the people management side is really difficult. Um, I in the context of switching between the builder and the people management piece because Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: you have to have so much empathy for what your your report is doing or your reports are doing and their development journey and the one-on- ones and keeping Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: up to date with their performance and what hap is happening on their side while also needing to context switch and like get into the weeds and build and then um the other uh get into the weeds and build. So that context switching can be difficult to complete that thought. 00:05:11 Zander Grant: But the Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Zander Grant: other piece of it is like um I don't know what would solve for this necessarily, but um the fact that you're building what what I mean by that specifically is like I'm quite literally in the weeds and I'm like building and I'm very like working on deadlines and working on a very specific comms and then as a leader we're supposed to also set the vision and the strategy for the work and the department overall uh you know the overall vision of where you're going and building out the road map and it's like uh you need time and creative space for that piece of it in my experience and like have time to connect with other leaders and bounce ideas and connect with your network and to to foster that. Shy Goodarzi: Well, Zander Grant: And that is very difficult to do when you're also tasked with the responsibility of building because Shy Goodarzi: yes. Zander Grant: it's it's any gap in your schedule that Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: you could theoretically use for that visioning and thinking gets filled with well let's go review that comms before it gets sent out or let's jump into this other meeting about this deadline that got pushed or otherwise. 00:06:09 Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Yes. Um, oh god, I really understand how you feel. Um, can you share with me how you think about prioritizing your time currently? Zander Grant: Um, yeah. So, I think that I'm one of the biggest benefits to my career is being in lock step with my manager and having like very clear like my the person who I'm reporting to Shy Goodarzi: What? Zander Grant: having very clear ideas of what success for them is and what is important for them and ultimately what they're going to ask for of me at end end of the week or end of the month or end of the quarter etc. So really having a clear road map of um what do I want to what story do I want to tell at the end of the quarter and I do this in like a lot of different areas of my

life but specifically at work sometimes I I don't necessarily write my touch point but what I like to do is Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Zander Grant: like frame what do I want to write in my touch point at the end of this quarter and then work backwards from there. 00:07:01 Zander Grant: Um, and then similarly with um, some of these like more strategic things or these things that are in motion, I I say, okay, at the end of this month, I'm going to write an update to my manager or to Eddie and what do I want to write in that update? And then it Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: allows me to have like a benchmark to work backwards from. Shy Goodarzi: Wow. Zander Grant: And then based on that, of having a very clear vision of what I want to achieve, then it makes it easier at the day-to-day to be able to say yes and no to specific things because I'm able to apply that filter. Does this support the story that I want to tell at the end of the month? Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. My god, you like I love this. This is so so smart, so thoughtful. Um, do you use any tools to help you with that? Zander Grant: Um, well, now I'm using CHP for everything. Um, to be honest, um, like it is probably my most used app. 00:07:47 Zander Grant: I would say almost like it's getting close to the point where I'm using Chat GPT more than Slack, which is like Shy Goodarzi: That's Zander Grant: one Shy Goodarzi: That's Zander Grant: of my goals because I have a whole TED talk that I could give to you about Slack. Um, but Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Yes. Zander Grant: how down with Slack? Um, but I would say Slack a lot. And then I'm just a big documentation person. So I do take I have so many docs which is kind of a problem because I have too many docs. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Zander Grant: Um, but I really do like the framing of like let me I'm going to write my touch point today as if it's like the quarter has already happened and Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: then working backwards from there. And then Slack, as much as I can talk negatively about Slack, um I do use like Slack bot reminders and otherwise to like, you know, keep myself more in the day-to-day and like the flow of work um Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. 00:08:29 Zander Grant: organized and then ruthlessly ruthlessly use my calendar. But like what I mean by that is like I'm like pulling up my calendar on like every single day like throughout the day like removing and deleting and adding um like not just like meetings of course uh like of course that's a part of it but more of like milestones for myself or like actually having that trying

to carve out that creative space to you know just block out my calendar to make sure I have space to think about an upcoming timeline Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Zander Grant: or deliverable. Shy Goodarzi: that's wow. Super interesting. Um, I also just want to comment on the like you're like, "Oh, I document everything." And I'm like, "Yes, because you come from this place of like needing to understand and know and like not having that documentation." And Zander Grant: One Shy Goodarzi: I Zander Grant: of the Shy Goodarzi: No. Zander Grant: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, keep going. Shy Goodarzi: No, no, no. I was just going to say like I feel you on that. 00:09:20 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: I think I mean it's getting to the point where now I talk about sources of truth or like having the source of truth for something and now it's like a reoccurring joke now. Like I mentioned something about it in a in a all hands meeting yesterday like with our Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: department and multiple Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: people messaged me like making a joke about how the fact I'm always asking for a source of truth because with so much ambiguity and I I'll keep this rant short but with Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: so much ambiguity in the world and in the Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: business what is Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: in our control is to like document what we're doing and the decisions that we're making. So I think sometimes we end up in these situations because we're self-inflicting. So I like to say what is in our control and our control is actually to take a few minutes to write down decisions and anyway Shy Goodarzi: Absolutely. I love that. Zander Grant: yeah 00:10:04 Shy Goodarzi: Um, okay. Uh, are there areas of your team's performance or development that you find hardest to influence? Zander Grant: nothing's coming to mind in that question and I think it's um yeah part of it uh just like the transition of this new role which is fair fairly recent not to use that as an excuse. Um but like me and my my current report are like very much in lock step and we're having we have a really good working relationship. I Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: think when I was director of cso and kind of overseeing the entire department that just made it a little bit more difficult because of the sheer number of humans involved. Um Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: and really ensuring I think the tension between better up is a place where you can develop and we really care about investing in yourself and inner work etc while also having the demands of like well there's a thousand tickets in the queue and like that work needs to happen. So there's Shy Goodarzi: What? Zander Grant: like some

tension there. 00:11:01 Zander Grant: Um, which I think is a common problem for a lot of us where it's like inner work and all of that definitely makes sense, but convincing yourself that like actually taking a beat and taking some creative space will actually support the end product I Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Zander Grant: think can be difficult when you're faced with a thousand tickets or you Shy Goodarzi: to Zander Grant: know inbox overflowing with requests. Shy Goodarzi: totally. Um, is there any Well, that's actually an interesting question now, but what what do you spend the most time on that you feel is low value? Zander Grant: Um, okay. Coordinating calendars. I spend way too much time coordinating calendars. Um, and I know that maybe that's like a ongoing thing, but I really do find like in the moment it's a point of frustration because I'm realizing how much time I'm like losing just trying to coordinate. And it's seems so silly, but it's like it actually does take up a lot of time and then it requires like so much back and forth and whatnot that it's kind of uh there has to be a solve for this kind of situation and 00:12:02 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: then tracking down the source of truth. Like going back to that piece, I'm Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: like how have like it gets so there's a point where I feel like there's just like a tipping point where I where I'm like okay now I'm annoyed or like now I'm frustrated because I've spent so much time where I'm like this is a really piece of like really valuable piece of information and the fact that no one knows where it is or where it lies or what the decision is on this is like of course annoying in the moment because I need it to unlock myself to do what I need to do. But then Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: also it's like but how like how is Shy Goodarzi: How's Zander Grant: this so Shy Goodarzi: that Zander Grant: important? Shy Goodarzi: possible? Zander Grant: How is Shy Goodarzi: Well, Zander Grant: this? Yeah. So there's those two things. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Zander Grant: Um I think I'll probably leave it there because I think that Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. 00:12:42 Zander Grant: those are Yeah. what comes to mind. Shy Goodarzi: Can you share a little bit more about like in calendar like Tetris like can you tell me a little bit more? Is it that like everyone's busy or is it figuring out that like are there certain things that are movable or is it like I know you interact with Bnee which is kind of a specific experience right where it's like someone who's not as like in the in the everyday as we are um or calendar calendarwise. Can you share Zander Grant: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: a little bit

more about that challenge? Zander Grant: Yeah. the specifics are with internal folks it is difficult because um not I mean I mean I don't I'm part of the problem as well because I have Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: my calendar as private um but like not knowing what blocks are flexible or like having to negotiate with someone's calendar is really difficult because oftentimes um at a certain level and with a certain um type of role everything's blocked out like you will pull up a calendar and literally everything is blocked out and so it's like does this mean that it is impossible to have any meetings 00:13:38 Shy Goodarzi: like Zander Grant: in Shy Goodarzi: conversation Zander Grant: the next Shy Goodarzi: with you. Zander Grant: right like is this like is this actually is this real life? Um, and then you and 99% of the time it's not, but Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Zander Grant: that's great, but then it still requires a conversation Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Zander Grant: and Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Zander Grant: that's one person Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Zander Grant: and then like but now you have to deal with like five other people. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: So that's a challenge and maybe this is like self feedback for myself where I need to open up more blocks or otherwise but Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: regardless. Um, and then I think with the brunet brunet component, what I was going to mention is that just like third parties makes it even more complex because I can't even see their calendar. Um, Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Zander Grant: so that makes it really Shy Goodarzi: Go through the Zander Grant: 100% Shy Goodarzi: email. Yeah. Yeah. Zander Grant: the back and forth. Thankfully, we have a lot of her team in Slack, so it's a little bit quicker. 00:14:24 Zander Grant: Um, Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Zander Grant: but still, it's like 2020, what year is it? 2025. And the Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: fact that I'm like having this much tension and spending an hour to like schedule an hour meeting, it just feels I think it's um frustrating because like if the task or the work the work itself was like this is how it has to be, it Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: would feel different. But like Shy Goodarzi: Right. Zander Grant: this does not feel like it's one of those things that like this is how the world needs to work. Shy Goodarzi: Absolutely. I'm sorry you're coming up against that and I completely understand. um in scheduling. It's just like Yeah. Um Zander Grant: This is inspiring though because now once Shy Goodarzi: yeah. Zander Grant: I have free time, I actually am going to like do my part and like clean up my calendar and make it very clear where my blocks are visible because sometimes Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: you just need to

talk out some of these things which 00:15:10 Shy Goodarzi: Totally. Zander Grant: um I don't know if I think this actually answers one of your questions or kind Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: of the questions that you're talking about but managers don't really talk managers have better up and like we've had a couple versions of this in my experience where we've gotten together as managers all hands um and that kind of situation. Um, but why it it comes up to me is because this like conversation itself is very helpful for like my day-to-day because I I literally will say like wow I did feel some type of way about my scheduling so I am going to make changes there Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: and speaking with other managers I think you have so many unlocks and every time we did small groups for example when we did those manager all hands we left away with feeling a really like feeling energized and feeling okay this isn't just me this isn't just my department like you have that like that true empathy with other managers and you literally have like takeaways that you can like start applying day one. 00:16:02 Zander Grant: Um, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: so there's that other component and I'm not sure which question that falls into, but it is kind of like actually I don't know how the other leaders are leading or what other challenges there are and Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: what like there's someone over in that department that could actually resolve this issue that I'm dealing with. I actually have no idea. Shy Goodarzi: Totally. That's a really really great and interesting point especially around like thinking about manage and like our product experience and how like the there's a huge lever and power of managers speaking to each other Zander Grant: I got Shy Goodarzi: and Zander Grant: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: like benefiting from that in many ways of like best practices. Oh, I know this thing and information sharing etc. Um yeah that's a really really good point. Um, okay. What are the biggest communication hurdles you face with your team or other teams? Zander Grant: Um, I only hesitate to say this because I am someone who I'm anti- victim mindset. So where what what that means to me is I I think of a answer and then I'm like how much do am I playing in this and like what should I be doing in this circumstance? 00:17:10 Zander Grant: But Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: I think that the silo of information is a little difficult. Like I really don't know even in network operations just to Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: uh put it out there. Sometimes I'm like I don't even know what that department's doing and they're in my department. You know what I mean? It's like um I actually don't know what your team right

now is like locked in and I think I should know those things and like to a degree, right? I shouldn't know all the details. position Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: know all the weeds, but like we have all connected tissue and like all of our comp all of our departments are connected in a lot of different ways. And even if they're not like directly connected, I could definitely cause you problems by setting expectations with with a partner or with coaches or otherwise, which is Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: like a trickle down effect. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: Um, and the opposite side of that is like we could support each other's missions if we actually knew them very clearly. 00:17:57 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: Um, and why where I go with like what could I be doing? I should probably network more and I should probably get clued in and whatnot. But to our earlier point, when you're challenged with being a leader and balancing the priorities and the weed and getting into the weeds, it it gets bumped down the priority list because it's not immediate, whereas this deadline or this touch point or this, you know, comms that needs to be sent out is. So, Shy Goodarzi: Yes, absolutely. Zander Grant: yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Um, it's a really good point and yes, you should know we should know what each other's working on and like the highle priorities and how we're thinking about things. It's a it's a really really good fair point. Have you heard of the release road map by Zander Grant: Yes. Shy Goodarzi: the way? Okay. I feel like that's products first pass at like trying to get everybody to understand like the big themes. Zander Grant: Love it. Shy Goodarzi: Um, and so I think you're you're raising a point that we're starting to feel across the or is like our account teams don't even know what we're building and it's like okay then they can't really sell it if they don't know what we're doing. 00:18:53 Zander Grant: Totally. Totally. And then similarly, I mean in customer support, if we Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: don't know what you're building, we can't forecast when we Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: need new support agents or new training. And then for my side of the business, I mean, it's I'm getting a little bit further away, but still Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: supporting coaches and facilitators. So, yeah, it's all Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: connect. Shy Goodarzi: Totally. Um, how do you currently support the growth and development of your team members? Zander Grant: My report and I have constant conversations. I think that it's like so I think one of the best things about us is that we're not about the working relationship that we have is that it's not like we have development conversations once a month or Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Zander

Grant: at touch point like truly that like line that we say often that like there should be no surprises in your touch point. I hear that often but like Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: we truly do live that like I feel like almost every day we're talking about her development and my development too. 00:19:42 Zander Grant: And I Shy Goodarzi: What? Zander Grant: really feel like we have that relationship where it's like we really are bettering ourselves or each other rather. So it's not just like top down or Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: feedback coming to from me to her. It's like Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: we're like she literally just provided feedback to me yesterday in a random uh not coffee chat but just like a random conversation that we ended up having and it's like a beautiful thing because Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: then I feel like she's actually invested in the conversation. Um I'm obviously invested in the conversation. So having that like free flow like development is almost like a norm. Like development conversations is like a daily practice almost Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Zander Grant: that we have and that Shy Goodarzi: Thank you. Zander Grant: I think is huge because then number one my report sees it like it's not just like um it's not that I'm just like talking the talk. It's like I'm walking the talk. It's like it's showing up in a day-to-day like the flow of work is has development like built in. And I think that that's huge um to get the the buyin from her. 00:20:37 Zander Grant: So then when there is constructive feedback or there is a pivot that we need to make, no one's caught off by surprise and she is, you know, approaching it very thoughtfully and has questions and has the context. Um, so I really do think like having that those development touch points like throughout your conversations throughout the year, maybe it's not daily, but Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: it's like I think it should be a con like consistent piece of the way that you communicate with your reports Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: because it goes such a long way. Shy Goodarzi: Hold Zander Grant: Uh Shy Goodarzi: on. Zander Grant: and yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. So I I love that point and it's like I think sometimes what I feel is that like there's so much pressure put on moments of feedback often Zander Grant: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: that like you or the other person feels like it's the biggest deal in the world when in reality it's like no no this is just like a a small thing to like adjust and change etc. And it's not like oh because of this you're going to have like a does not meet expectation. 00:21:32 Shy Goodarzi: And I think that there's like this connection between feedback and like performance that I

feel like we need to decouple in many ways of this informs that but it's not the determining one determining factor Zander Grant: Spot on. And I think that the decoupling is such it takes so much pressure off of it. Like you said, there's not like this like, oh gosh, what feedback is going to come up? It's like, oh, we're actually this is like another conversation that we've had because we've had 10 conversations about Shy Goodarzi: about Zander Grant: develop. Shy Goodarzi: it. Zander Grant: Yeah, Shy Goodarzi: Exactly. Zander Grant: exactly. Shy Goodarzi: Exactly. Zander Grant: Love that. Shy Goodarzi: Um okay. I know we're close to time. the I feel like these last couple questions are fun ones. Um, is there any data or insights that you wish you had or would want to help support you as a manager? Zander Grant: Is there any data? I think I may have to get back to you on that. I Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. 00:22:25 Zander Grant: nothing like really comes to mind. the the Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: first thing that came to mind is like how much time I'm spending in meetings or how much time my report is spending in me meetings. Um the reason why I didn't go with it though is like actually have a pretty good understanding of like we do check in on a regular Shy Goodarzi: Oh, Zander Grant: basis. Like we Shy Goodarzi: come. Zander Grant: do a like a bandwidth scan on a regular basis. I think that maybe like having an easier way to well we go back and forth with me and my report and I've done this multiple times where we've like listed out roles and responsibilities on like how much time is being dedicated to what and Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Zander Grant: that allows us to like very clearly rep prioritize but nothing that we've created really has stuck. So like that's kind of a con common uh question that I bring up to my report and I think sometimes it can come off like I'm trying to micromanage and it's truly not that. 00:23:12 Zander Grant: It's just like, no, I'm actually just trying to figure out what your bandwidth is and like how much bandwidth is spent where and I have no expectation that your bandwidth is 100% filled. Shy Goodarzi: So Zander Grant: That's when it's problematic. But so Shy Goodarzi: yeah, Zander Grant: maybe like there is something in there of like a bandwidth um measuring tool or something Shy Goodarzi: understand. Yeah. Zander Grant: um where it's Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: like, yeah, 30% of my time is dedicated on this, 30 is on this, and 30 is like free time. And it's like, okay, great. Now I know where you're at. And Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Zander Grant: then when it's like reaches when the meter reaches like 100% bandwidth I'm like okay Shy Goodarzi: we

Zander Grant: we need Shy Goodarzi: gotta Zander Grant: to Shy Goodarzi: talk. Zander Grant: yeah Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: we talk Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Okay. Oh, I love that. Um, okay. Last question for you. If you were to design a tool for managers or for yourself as a manager, what would it help you or support you to do? 00:24:00 Zander Grant: uh what would it do? I think it would have um a deeper understanding of the flow of work of my report. Um and again, I think that it's I already have that like in the in the relationship that I have now, but it is it takes a lot of time. So, it takes a lot of and what did you do on that day and like how did that launch go and like having those conversations are great because there's like time for connection and whatnot, but Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Zander Grant: if you have more than one report, it gets really difficult really fast. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Zander Grant: Um and at better up that tends to be well just in the world you know uh teams inflate and Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Zander Grant: you get stretched even further. So then having a pulse check like having uh your manager ask my manager ask me and how's your team doing? I need a really strong answer of like how is my team doing and also in touch points I need a really strong understanding of what my team did over that course of the last six months or whatever the time period is. 00:24:54 Zander Grant: So, I do think I don't like the word tracker necessarily because sometimes it has a bad connotation, but Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: like some way of really knowing the week over week of like what my report is working on and what's uh working well and what's not. We used to have was that software before where it was like uh we did weekly check-ins in it. It Shy Goodarzi: 15 Zander Grant: was like Shy Goodarzi: times. Zander Grant: 155. Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: It's really funny because when we were uh talking about renewing or not, uh Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: HR like interviewed me because I was my percentage was like 99% or something. I was using it week over a week because I found it such an easy way to like list out my five priorities for the Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: week and not and then my manager and I actually had conversations about it. of like hey this continues to be a priority and this does not need to be a priority so let's take it off and then 00:25:37 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: as manager I was literally able to see like everything that they had done for that period and Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Zander Grant: that's great so Shy Goodarzi: Yeah.

Zander Grant: uh there's something something there I think Shy Goodarzi: Somebody capture that data. Yeah. Yes. Well, Xander, um it was lovely to see you and catch up just a little bit and I really appreciate like your your candidness and and your thoughts here. Um, Zander Grant: All Shy Goodarzi: and so yeah, thank you for your time. I'm going to aggregate across like I think at least like 12 managers that Zander Grant: right. Shy Goodarzi: I've managed across the business and I'll I'll share obviously with you and others. And this is really because we want to start to build tools for managers that will help support them and make their lives easier. Um, and so more to come soon and I just appreciate your time. Zander Grant: Yeah. Awesome. plus or if there's one that you're like, I would like, Hey you mentioned, you didn't have much at the moment but if you think Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Zander Grant: about it, more happy to plus anything else. Shy Goodarzi: Thank you. I really appreciate it. Zander Grant: See you soon. Shy Goodarzi: Or to see.

Amol Kher utilizes AI to draft performance feedback and finds value in saboteur assessments for team dynamics, while also highlighting the need to align WPM data with competency mapping and incorporate non-self-reported performance data. Details Current Role and Team Structure Amol Kher leads the engineering team at BetterUp, managing a large team of managers and reporting to approximately 8-9 direct reports out of a broader team of 70-100 people. The team is typically structured by function or initiative, currently focusing on product and platform engineering. Amol Kher noted that this structure is not uniquely different from their experiences in other organizations (). Top Management Challenges One of the primary challenges Amol Kher faces is effectively cascading information in a fast-evolving startup environment with a large team (). Amol Kher also emphasized the importance of ensuring that individuals within the company are keeping pace with the company's growth and have continuous development opportunities. According to Amol Kher, communication cascades are made more difficult in a remote work environment due to different time zones and locations, affecting both the transmission and reception of information (). Performance Management Approach Amol Kher described their approach to performance management, which includes company-wide performance plans, bi-annual check-ins, and monthly one-on-one meetings focused on bidirectional feedback and performance-oriented discussions (). These monthly meetings utilize a shared document for topic preparation, supplementing the formal HR-driven processes. While formal feedback occurs monthly, Amol Kher also provides in-the-moment feedback as needed (). Low-Value Time

Investment Amol Kher feels that the time spent on ensuring the absorption of communicated information can be low-value, not because the communication itself isn't important, but because the current process feels manual and lacks a systematic way to gauge understanding (). Amol Kher mentioned experimenting with summarizing key takeaways at the end of meetings to improve immediate comprehension. However, the subsequent analysis and follow-up still require significant time investment (). Utilizing AI for Performance Feedback Amol Kher has been using AI to assist with drafting performance feedback, leveraging one-on-one discussions and Slack conversations from the past six months through custom prompts (). This process helps Amol Kher address the challenge of recalling detailed conversations over time and allows for the inclusion of expectations for reaching the next performance level. Most people have appreciated the clarity this provides regarding their growth path (). Calibration and Peer Feedback in Performance Reviews Amol Kher discussed the time-intensive nature of performance calibration across a large team to identify outliers and ensure consistent ratings (). A challenge Amol Kher encountered with their AI tool was the difficulty in incorporating peer assessments, as their focus was primarily on one-on-one interactions. While the team conducts 360 feedback on their own timelines for development, integrating peer feedback into the formal performance review process remains a challenge for Amol Kher (). Team Dynamics and Saboteur Assessment Amol Kher has found value in using the saboteur assessment during team offsites to understand the team's collective strengths and potential failure modes. By having team members share their top saboteurs and strengths, Amol Kher aims to foster awareness of the team's DNA and how to work together effectively (). Amol Kher believes this shared understanding helps with team cohesion and can inform decisions about pairing individuals on projects (). Hiring Considerations Based on Team Dynamics While not a direct factor, understanding team dynamics through assessments like saboteurs can subtly influence hiring considerations by highlighting potential gaps or areas where different perspectives are needed to avoid groupthink. Amol Kher emphasized the importance of balancing team strengths rather than aiming for uniformity, considering the specific needs of product and platform teams (). Ultimately, hiring decisions are primarily driven by required skills and the need to supplement existing team expertise (). Value of WPM and Competency Mapping Amol Kher believes that the WPM data would be more valuable if aligned with the company's existing competency mapping, such as the seven pillars and job competencies. Mapping WPM scores to these competencies would simplify performance check-ins by providing a standardized way to assess individual development in areas like horizontal leadership (). Amol Kher also suggested that benchmarking these mapped scores against industry averages could provide additional value for both employees and managers (). The Need for Non-Self-Reported Performance Data Amol Kher expressed concern about the reliance on self-reported data in performance evaluations, suggesting that incorporating a third-party perspective is necessary (). While self-reported data might be suitable for understanding individual preferences and thinking styles, performance evaluations would

benefit from non-self-reported data, potentially gathered through manager-led group 360 feedback sessions aligned with competency frameworks (). Amol Kher proposed a more streamlined approach to gathering this feedback during existing team meetings . Suggested next steps No suggested next steps were found for this meeting.

Yeah. Yeah. Gemini. Okay. Can you describe your current role and what your team is responsible for? Sure. I lead the engineering team here at BetterUp. Um um yeah, I'm responsible for managing a large team. Mhm. Jo of managers. We're managers of managers. Okay. And how long have you been in a management role? Probably 15 years. Amazing. Uh how many people do you manage currently? Directly probably about 89. Okay. Okay. Uh the team broadly is about um 70 or 100 people. Okay. I would say managers probably about 20. Okay. Do you manage any individual contributors or all managers? Okay. No, I managed. Okay. Okay. And how is your team structured? usually structured by function or a particular area of an initiative. 00:01:21 Amol Kher: So you know um today they structured by teams that focus on product engineering, teams that focus on platform engineering and in the past they've also been structured by what you would call like web web engineering or back end engineering. Roughly right now it's more platform and product. Platform and product. And have you clearly you've managed in other organizations before if so how does this experience compare? In what way? Uh do you do you feel that um like the setup and your current role feels like applicable to where you were in the past? Yeah. I mean there there's nothing really like unique deviations. Yeah. Okay. Let's get into the more interesting questions. What are the top two to three challenges you face as a manager right now? It's often, you know, cascading information in a startup. Things evolve quickly when you have a large team. How do you make sure you set up the systems that help you um cascade whatever is the executive like decisions or just emerging insights and how do you make sure everyone is aware of it because in a smaller company you need to have this information available to people who are closer to the work. 00:03:12 Amol Kher: So yeah, communication cascades are probably one top issue. There always surfaces in in my world. Um you know general sort of um making sure that people are keeping pace with their development as a company. you know as a startup we have to grow people have to grow along with that and so making sure that there is like constant attention and growth opportunities for people both those are very interesting I want

to start with the cascading piece can you tell me today what makes that challenging or like what what your yeah what challenges you face in cascading um usually it's mostly because of like you It becomes more difficult in a remote work environment I would say because people are in different time zones, people are in different locations and so information just generally moves slower. Okay. People it's it's both on the transmission but also on on reception. So in transmission making sure that I can be um more disciplined about uh sending out updates or any new uh insights that I I get aware of and I can do that through like weekly staff meetings or that kind of stuff but then actually making sure that the reception is happening and that there is a you call it um that they've understood because there's there's always a gap between your trans what you're transferring and what the 00:04:58 Amol Kher: people are saying. So you generally don't find enough time in the day for even in a week to kind of make sure that what what I said did that make sense? Yes. How do you what are the cues or signals to you that help you know that a people haven't understood it or they have? Well, the have the easy it's easier to know when they have okay because then you start seeing them make you know make sometimes make the changes that might be needed okay or sometimes there's no need for it but I think it's more clearer when they get the message and they internalize that and they like okay so this means I have to do X or Y right there's an action there's an action there um I think it's harder to know when they have not caught Okay. Okay. That usually shows up a little bit delayed when uh a decision needed to be made which they probably didn't because they didn't fully understand the context or Yeah. Um what's the other signal or symptom? 00:06:09 Amol Kher: Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes it's probably just they they've not even seen it. Mhm. For for some time. Okay. Because of information overload, totally. It's like, yeah, I I totally get that. On the other side of like talking about performance and needing to see performance and growth because we're growing so quickly, can you share more about how you approach that today? Yeah, so today it goes through it at least goes through the standard like you know companywide performance sort of plans, right? where you have government check-ins and then one like check in here in my world. One of the things we've done is that I've done a monthly so I I I do a monthly one-hour one-on-one which is more focused on uh birectional feedback and also exploring, you know, how more performanceoriented one-on-one I would say. Um, and then people are free to do more tactical meetings, one-on-

ones with me during the month. Okay. But this gives me uh enough sort of flexibility on my personal calendar as well as for my team to know that there's a meeting coming every month that's more performance oriented. 00:07:43 Amol Kher: Um, they usually there's like usually a one-on-one deck uh sorry, a dock that we use and you know we'll sort of add their topics. I add my stuff in there. Um, and so that's generally the system that we have besides the actual formal like process process that the HR teams run. Yes. So those are the two sort of I would say systems that I have. Do you ever feel like monthly like are you also giving feedback like in the moment like yeah so that happens I think this is more performance from a point of view of growth and um you know what what is what is the environment and what is the um yeah what is the work sort of telling us about where where the other person is headed. and sort of constantly checking in to see you know how are they thinking about their you know whatever we've discussed in the performance review how are you doing towards that right like and if there are opportunities that open up or there's an opportunity that I see then that's also a discussion that's the goal of that meeting say hey I I see there's a need for some help here you've said in the past that you want to try these things do you want to do that sort of stuff got it Uh but this the the more practical feedback like someone who maybe didn't have a great meeting that that doesn't I don't wait for you don't 00:09:17 Amol Kher: wait you just give that okay yes that makes sense. Um, what do you spend the most time on right now that you feel is low value? Um, low value. Mhm. I think when it comes to it's probably more in this communication casket stuff. Okay. It's not I don't know if I can say it's low value. Okay. I it's high value because it's obviously important from a communications like the outcome point of view. I would say it is more road work that uh if if there was a a better system that would help me understand the absorption of the message. Okay. Um that would be that would be high value because right now it feels very individual and manual. Yeah. And it's, you know, it's almost like some with some people you build some wrap over time as you work longer with them. You kind of build an intuition of like, okay, I send this message, how are they going to react to that or how are they going to absorb that and will they, you know, instantly get my communication to them? 00:10:49 Amol Kher: Uh, because everyone has a different style of talking to

each other. So that's one. So that feels a little there was a more systematic way in which uh at least like the base level of coms were easier easily sort of yeah so one of the things I've started doing maybe in the last like uh month month and a half um actually got through my own coach like where she would often she often reserves like two minutes at the end of the meeting to say okay what did you what did you learn like what what did you get out of this this session and summarize that from you and so I have tried to do that as a way to sort of get a like you know people have a discussion yeah okay so what should people take away from the discussion because then it helps me so what I've not been able to do after that is like really kind of synthesize like okay so said this I think he got that or I I'm guessing he understands this but N said this and maybe he's not yet fully there and then that kind of leads to okay let's make sure he follow up with him and sort of stuff but that analysis or that it's more of this like not having the time to go take the next step now and maybe maybe it's just a matter of like you do it a few times we see it see 00:12:19 Amol Kher: the patterns and then you start like optimizing for that and get there. But there's a lot of I'd love for some consistency around that whether it's in meetings or in my staff meetings. So interesting. Yeah. Okay. On the performance management stuff. Yeah. One thing I had to do this this time I need to follow. uh when I when I gave feedback obviously used AI for doing a lot of the performance feedback stuff um I went through because it's hard for me to remember like six months of like conversation with people um I essentially created my own like prompt that takes into account the one-on-one talk the um Slack conversations that people have had. So just time box it to like the 6 months. And then insert all that into this this like document or whatever and yeah or um you know Gemini and then essentially I gave it our like my proposed reading. Mhm. whatever the four are also gave it some context got better up in general essentially um asked it to write the first draft of the feedback okay and then you know to go and edit a little bit of things in there but it also I was also one of the feedback I got out of that was that first of all I made it clear that this was a lot of it was generated but it was based on 00:14:10 Amol Kher: this input okay and And but the thing that most

people also like is that in the prompt itself I had said so someone was getting a developer rating developing rating. Yeah. What do they need to do to get to um what's the next one? The last one is outstanding forget the name. Uh it's not neat but it's something it's called something new now. Yeah. Sorry. But anyway, I basically was able to sort of say, hey, this person is at this. Yeah. And their next rating is this. What do they need to do based on this conversations and they want expectations and you know their role definition. So I sort of given it all of like the competency management. Interesting. Okay. I said give me give me what they need to do to get to that level. Okay. Of performance. Yeah. And I think most people appreciated that because they were like, "Okay, I see the difference between this and and so now I know if I want to a lot of these people are very senior, so there's not there's not an expectation that every every quarter they're trying to get outstanding. 00:15:24 Amol Kher: It's not hard. It's it's hard to do that especially if um um you're trying to be calibrating across a lot of people." Yeah. So I think that's one thing the think more about that a lot of the calibration processes where take longer because you have to for like large even for 70 people of IC's like you're constantly trying to um see like the outliers like you know trying to look for who's outstanding who's like um developing or needs improvements or stuff and then make sure you set those edges correctly first and so that requires a lot of back and forth. Yeah, a lot of that can be very subjective. Yes, and it really depends on a lot of times like the managers doing a lot of that pre-work on that stuff. Okay. But getting that to be more I would say um yeah maybe more standardized and maybe having some tools that make it easier would be actually helpful. Yeah. The way the way we run the process here is often like you before you actually do the touch point while while all of us are writing our own evals, managers are often writing their first like eval like first assessment. 00:16:56 Amol Kher: Yeah. Not the not the text of it but their assessment of the performance. Then you get into a calibration meeting and then try and gauge like relative. Okay. Am I being too lenient? Am I being too harsh? Right? And then that adjustment factors in the final review that they give while they write the notes as well because during that time they might also get some peer feedback, right? So they might have seen their own assessment but so one of the challenges for me uh when I was doing this like my my own tool it was not

easy for me to get the peer assessments right for for the team because I was looking at my one-on-one channel with them uh it's not easy for me to know what is the team saying about so this person so um like the like a 360. Yeah, like we we've done 360s. My team has done I've asked them to do 360s in general, but they do that on their own timelines with you. 00:18:02 Amol Kher: Um, and that that's helpful, but that's a little bit more employee driven. Yeah. And I am sort of I'm one of the participants and employee and coach driven. Um, and that's more of like a development check-in, I would say. Okay. But this is like performance checkin. Yeah. And so I've different people have done different things like you know Allison has her like Google form that she sends around. Um it's based on our job competency mapping. So it's like all those like horizontal leadership cascades um choice cascades and whatnot. Mhm. Um so she typically has like a template that she uses and then she uses that to say hey I'm giving feedback to this person can you send out that whole management is like quite a bit of painful stuff as in like takes time it's valuable so that's why I'm like I my original thing is like I think they're all valuable they just take too long for how quickly they can go. Yes, understood. Um, wow, there's a lot in there. 00:19:18 Amol Kher: There's one aspect that I I've always sort of felt like um when we first started working on manage I was doing my team offsite at incentives at some point and I noticed that a lot of the you know during the offsets typically there's a section around like um team you know uh dynamics right how is the working well together. And one exercise that we've done since we don't we don't have you know there's a lot of different like frameworks people can use like uh myers breaks and whatnot but we uh a lot of the folks I knew had done the uh sabotur assessment. Yes. And so I just had people look at the salvator assessment for everyone and we actually did a collective session just like let's look at the top three strengths of top whatever saboturs and of that everyone in the group try and understand what is the general DNA of the team and what are our overall um areas in which we can you know if the team is balanced in one way or like imbalanced in one way then we all have to be aware that this is our failure mode right that when something like this happens when we have to be extra sort of vision or when something like this happens it's our sabotur's acting so not to overreact to that kind of stuff so those exercises have been very helpful

in like getting any kind of data okay so for me I don't really care that it's sabotur it could also 3.0 It's like here's my score. 00:21:04 Amol Kher: Yeah. Across my team. I don't need to know the I don't even I mean I think in this case you need to know the individual scores and I just want to know what the top strengths are, right? And I actually think that they're more useful when they're shared. Yeah. Cuz I think sometimes people like, well that's my private personal data. Interesting. Um but I personally think that it's useful only in the context of what it tells other people how to work with you. Okay. Um and then it actually helps me understand the other person better. Okay, they're strong at this that this is an area of their growth and generally the management philosophy that most managers that I know who are good is like focus on your strengths. And so then they'll try and say, "Okay." Yeah. Yeah. That's really that's really interesting because then it also helps me understand if I'm pairing someone what are what is going to be a clash versus not a clash. 00:22:13 Amol Kher: Yeah, but you can also then avoid the clash by saying I'm putting you two together because you have a strength in this, you have a strength in this and I need both of them in this project. That's what I'm saying. So that's the sort of stuff that I haven't been able to do more frequently. Okay, because it's hard to pull all of that information and you require generally an HR BP like G used to be very good. She joins all my um you know off sites last year and then she would put together like you know um work with people and say can you send me your cyber tours and then we can sort of map it out and say here's my what my team looks like. Typically HRVPs want to do some of that stuff because they're thinking about team cohesion and growth and specifically as a partner to the leader. They're trying to figure out okay well sometimes the question is do we need to h if you're hiring someone what do we need to look for in hire so I mean that could be one simple recommendation you can do in manage which is your team has these things you strengthen your team here's the next person these are the skills you might want to look for totally but I'm curious about that actually when you look to hire 00:23:32 Amol Kher: it sounds like you would opt for someone that balances out your team to be able to be well-rounded, right? But is there also like there may be a reason why your team is leaning towards one direction because of the work that you do, right? So, how do you think about like is that

actually helpful information? Would you ever approach hiring conversations based on that information? Um, it doesn't directly it's it's sort of one of those things where it percolates in the back of your head. Okay. Yeah. And you're not your goal is to not just say like oh I want a team that's like you know it's like 100 100 points across the board because you're right maybe the project or the nature of the teams might skew one way or the other but what you want to do is avoid group think right so you want some some people some of the times be you know balancing and pulling and just sort of questioning the decision. Yeah. So you're really looking for for that also really depends on the team structure. 00:24:37 Amol Kher: Um some people are you know if it was organized by yeah if it was organized by um functions you can find a lot of variation say in like web engineering or mobile engineering within that group there could be a lot of different dynamics. Yeah. When you have it organized by like product and platform, yeah, you typically skew all of one type of people in one area and one type of people in other areas. So to say, yeah, people product engineering have more skill set on like customer empathy, you want to kind of experiment faster, that sort of stuff. Platform folks are a little bit more long-term thinkers, that sort of stuff. So you're it really depends on individual team units. Um yeah so it doesn't I wouldn't say where where it ultimately for hiring stuff it kind of comes into um skill okay so I'm am I looking for a in our like am I looking for an AI leader okay maybe I'm looking for an AI leader okay so we already have Jordan what so what kind of leader am I looking for that's not going to be that's going to supplement it's not going to a replica. 00:26:00 Amol Kher: Yeah. So, I think it's one of those things. Okay. Um I think just the having that information is useful. Okay. Whether you want to use that information for a specific hire, it really is a judgment call. Sometimes you do want like you're going to say, well, Jordan, you don't have a uh second intern who's like you, who can execute exactly like you. Maybe we want to hire more junior person but totally um very similar to your skill set. Yeah. But really depends on maybe in a different situation. No actually we need someone who is who is expert in this systems just not what you have. Totally. Uh but then also makes it easier clear for Jordan to help. Totally. Okay. Okay, I know I have to let you go, but the last question I'll ask you is you mentioned like the savurers and you're like it doesn't really matter what the data is

cuz they kind of all exist. Would you say for the WPM that it feels holistic enough that you would say that is good enough for me to be able to do something like that or is there something missing from the WPM that you're like I wish it did this thing? 00:27:09 Amol Kher: Well, so I think the WPM piece the way I've kind of seen it is that it's more aligned to um the more sciency part of it. Yes. If you already have competency mapping, yes, that would be more valuable cut for me. Okay. So let's just take the seven pillars in the job competencies. horizontal leadership, choice cascade, peak performance, base setting. So those things that we have for managers, yes, if you map the WBM scores to those, yes, and then now show me how's my team doing across all of them. It makes my job when I do the performance checkin easier as well because I have to put like individual scores for people to say Is this person sort of developing in horizontal leadership or outstanding in horizontal? Cuz that informs my final sort of I mean given that we are in engineering, we try to you know be more precise around because people want more information like why did you give me this thing like oh well here's how I'm assessing you on these seven kind of competencies and you can debate each one of them but you know and this is how my rating kind of comes out. 00:28:30 Amol Kher: Mhm. Um so it's I'm not the WPM stuff. It's actually we have an advantage where we can actually convert that into a competency map that would actually give me more value. Yeah. Um it's a really interesting way to look at it. Yeah. Because then it's standardized across all people. I think the other piece I would say is that the an interesting an untapped like resource that we have is that you could also then map those scores into an industry benchmark. Yeah. Cuz then it could tell me what is a uh director what is the average score in this? Yes. In the industry and how are you doing across that? Yes. that could be a value for them. It could be a value for me and that sort of stuff. Totally. The last piece on that that I'll say is I feel like we get stuck with the self-reported data and that's something I think we'll need to address in the near future is like everybody's like I get this and it makes sense but it doesn't make sense to only have self-reported data because especially if you're thinking about performance etc. There's a lot of things. 00:29:43 Amol Kher: All of these other ones like Sabs and Minus bricks are also self-reported, but that isn't performance. That's just kind of telling you, right? So, I feel like if it goes into the world

of performance, it feels like you would definitely need a third like a different perspective including self-reported data. If it's more around like what is the type of how do you think who like who are you? To me, that could be self-reported and that's great, but to those are two different ideas. I mean, you could do a thing where then you can get the non self-reported data by enabling the manager to do like a group 360. Yes, totally. Right. And you say, "Okay, here's all my here's the seven competencies." Competencies. Yep. Um create a web app. It's like straightforward. click radio buttons on each one of them and we basically have everyone in the group anonymously they you know say oh how do you feel someone is in that and that would give me a good picture too totally yeah so I mean if you want to there are ways in which you can use the manager to kind of build that nonsense data totally which is maybe a lot less you know the 360 feels a lot more heavier today because it's async And you have to do a lot of like people do that in their individual time. Mh. But every manager what they saw does a weekly meeting with does once a quarter or some longer time frame. Mhm. Why not align that to a live the same time feedback session gathering time? You get a trove of data immediately in that day and and the manager is interested in the value they're getting out of it. Totally. down. Yeah you just log in like Okay here's the system. That's all good things here, yeah. All right. Results. You solved everything. Thank you so much for your time.

They emphasize the importance of connecting individual work to organizational goals (OKRs) to foster a shared understanding of impact and wish for tools that make these implicit connections explicit and provide easier access to impact data. Darshan Bhatt also highlighted communication hurdles arising from differing interpretations of terminology and the difficulties associated with delivering effective feedback, while currently leveraging tools like Google Docs and Workday for team management and exploring AI for career development and strategic thinking. Details Current Role and Responsibilities Darshan Bhatt is an Engineering Manager overseeing two to three teams, primarily focused on manage and mobile areas. They have approximately 13 years of experience in management and currently manage nine individuals, including one manager (). Top Managerial Challenges Darshan Bhatt identified two main challenges rooted in navigating ambiguity: creating a clear strategy and providing enough clarity for the team to operate autonomously. They manage this

by discussing goals in one-on-ones, sharing information, documenting objectives and potential paths, and holding space for alternative ideas, as well as co-creating practice updates with the mobile team (). Darshan Bhatt believes a tool that keeps the "why" behind actions top of mind would be beneficial (). Impact of Ambiguity and Mindset Darshan Bhatt clarified that the challenge isn't necessarily a problem, but more about empowering individuals to navigate ambiguity and make decisions by understanding the impact of their work on organizational goals (). They noted a shift from retroactively assessing impact to proactively considering the desired impact (). Darshan Bhatt suggested building a habit of regularly checking in on objectives and key results (OKRs) to reinforce this mindset (). Low-Value Activities Darshan Bhatt feels that spending repeated time discussing unchangeable past events is a low-value activity, hindering forward progress (). They equate value with progress and see dwelling on the past as an impediment to moving forward (). Communication Hurdles A significant communication challenge for Darshan Bhatt's teams is the use of the same words with different meanings, leading to a lack of shared understanding. They have observed this issue recently, particularly with technical terminology, where terms like "cohort" can have multiple interpretations (). Supporting Team Growth and Development Darshan Bhatt currently supports team member growth using the company's career leveling guide in one-on-ones and by conducting quarterly 360 feedback processes (). They noted a desire to utilize the company's internal 360 tool more but face limitations in initiating it for direct reports (). Challenges in Giving Feedback Darshan Bhatt finds giving feedback, especially 360 feedback, challenging, emphasizing the difficulty of providing actionable feedback that serves the recipient and remains objective (). They believe this is a broader challenge due to a lack of training and the high emotional intelligence required to do it effectively (). While acknowledging it's difficult for them personally, Darshan Bhatt believes the company does it better than most, but there's still room for improvement () (). Current Tools for Team Management Darshan Bhatt primarily uses Google Docs for one-on-one notes and Workday for the 360 feedback process, although they wish to transition to the company's internal 360 tool (). Data Needs for Effective Management Darshan Bhatt expressed a need for easier, ideally automated, access to data on the impact of completed work. Currently, obtaining this data often requires manual and sometimes difficult pulling of information (). They gave the example of needing to manually determine the number of team members in specific groups (). Ideal Tool for Managers If Darshan Bhatt could design a tool, it would help make implicit understandings explicit and explicitly support the team in navigating ambiguity (). This tool would facilitate a clearer connection between individual work and organizational goals (). Making the Implicit Explicit Darshan Bhatt explained that making the implicit explicit means clearly linking an individual's work and impact to the company's objectives (OKRs) (). They referenced the concept of Management by Objectives (MBOs) where objectives cascade down

to every individual, creating a transparent and traceable connection (). This would help team members understand how their work contributes to the organization's progress (). Benefits of Explicit Alignment Darshan Bhatt believes explicitly linking individual work to organizational goals would address a potential question of whether their work moves the organization forward (). This clear tie-in would also likely influence prioritization and keep leadership accountable (). Current Use of AI in Management Darshan Bhatt currently uses AI to aid in career conversations, potentially for role-playing scenarios. They also encourage their team to utilize AI to enhance their work, and personally use it for brainstorming strategy and tactics, as well as for capturing and documenting ideas (). Suggested next steps No suggested next steps were found for this meeting. You should review Gemini's notes to make sure they're accurate.

So, can you describe your current role and what your team is responsible for? Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. So my current role is an em of it's two three teams depending on how you look at it. Um but the main pieces are manage uh and um mobile. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: So managing those three teams and that maybe teams is not quite right but yeah I would say like two three main areas Shy Goodarzi: Yes. And I guess uh how long have you been in a management role overall, not just at Betterup? Darshan Bhatt: 2011 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: and then I took a year off of managing. Um, so whatever that is, I can do the math. So about 13 years. Shy Goodarzi: Wow. Wow. And how many people do you currently manage? Darshan Bhatt: Uh, like 10 or 11. Let me see. Shy Goodarzi: My gosh. Darshan Bhatt: I should know this off the top of my head, but I do not. 00:01:35 Shy Goodarzi: Well, Darshan Bhatt: It changes often, Shy Goodarzi: I'm Darshan Bhatt: you Shy Goodarzi: sure Darshan Bhatt: know. Shy Goodarzi: while you're looking that up, um, do you manage IC's and managers or one or the other? Darshan Bhatt: Just recently, I have in the past, but um just recently at better up Sorry, I have to log in to work day and it takes its sweet time. Shy Goodarzi: No worries. You were just saying though that um at betterup you recently are managing Darshan Bhatt: A ma a manager a Shy Goodarzi: a Darshan Bhatt: single Shy Goodarzi: manager. Darshan Bhatt: manager. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Okay. Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: But before that it was all IC's mainly. Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Okay. Darshan Bhatt: Okay. Let's see. Here we go. Nine Shy Goodarzi: I saw you catch. Darshan Bhatt:

words. Shy Goodarzi: It's incredible. Incredible. Okay, we're going to take a step back and I want you to share with me if possible the top two to three challenges that you face as a manager today. 00:02:59 Darshan Bhatt: Yeah, I think it comes from the I would say they're two challenges but kind of the same thing at the root of them and it's um creating a clear strategy and then also providing enough clarity so the team can navigate ambiguity on their own. So yeah, I guess the root is both of the root is um navigating ambiguity, but there's like two pieces to that. one is like clear strategy and then clear tactics. Um and um with different teams I'm at different places in that. Shy Goodarzi: How have you managed that today? Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. So for for the teams where it's more on the tactics side, it's um a combination of you know talking about it during one-on- ons and also just sharing as much information as I can and documenting um what I see as the goal. um potential ways to get to that goal, but then also, you know, um holding space um explicitly for other ideas to get to that goal. Um and then for this one that's more on the strategy side, kind of a similar thing, but documenting more of the strategy. 00:04:54 Darshan Bhatt: Um and maybe also for mobile also updates to the practices and um kind of co-creating that with the team and with the goal of you know having alignment and then um also buy in and ultimately being able to hand it off. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Can you share a little bit more about these two challenges that you just outlined? Like what is there something that would help you solve for this? Like is there some like is there something missing? Whether it's like uh like like a strate strategic vision or it's a tool or whatever. Is there something missing Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: that you're like this would actually just help me solve this? Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Yeah, I I think if there was a tool to keep keep the why behind action top of mind. Um, and you know, one of the ways I've attempted doing this myself is in one-on- ons, just having a very clear um impact and activity and discussing that and um talking about it with with individuals um and constantly calling out the impact is what's important, not the activity. 00:06:38 Darshan Bhatt: Um and then just you know I think getting more explicit um on that and yeah and always having a tie into the impact and then obviously a mechanism for that impact to ladder up to you know at better it's like the TPS or the goals that we have as a as an organization. Shy Goodarzi: What are the like what is the impact of the like situation that you're

in? Like is it that um like there's maybe engineer I'm just guessing maybe are there engineers working on things that are not important or is it that there's less motivation because they don't know why like what is the what is the problem um that you're seeing? Darshan Bhatt: It's not it's it's not so much. It's not so much like a a problem per se, but it's, you know, we used to get this question asked a lot, which is, is this the best thing you can be doing? And I was like, what do you mean? You know, I I always had a hard time internalizing that. And I think this is more to help with that. 00:07:57 Darshan Bhatt: um by keeping the why of anything top of mind. So you know the okay so what's the problem that it's trying to solve? I guess it's providing the tools to individuals to navigate ambiguity and make decisions without having to Shy Goodarzi: I mean Darshan Bhatt: be Shy Goodarzi: the Darshan Bhatt: like Shy Goodarzi: Perfect. Darshan Bhatt: is this the right is this right? Yeah. It's like Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: the the answer is well is it moving us closer or further away from the Shy Goodarzi: Got Darshan Bhatt: impact that we're trying to have? So it's I think it's maybe empowering those micro decisions. Shy Goodarzi: That's so interesting. It also feels like it's kind of like some some of what you're speaking to is also like mindset stuff, Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: right? Darshan Bhatt: Very much. Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: That's Darshan Bhatt: the the conversation has gone like when you started it's always retro like we're looking Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: back and like oh what was the impact of this activity and now that we've started talking about it it's what impact do you want to have and working from that as opposed 00:09:01 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: to ending with But Shy Goodarzi: Well, it's so interesting because you went to you went to tooling for like, hey, how can we like as as they're thinking about what to do like they keep the like why top of mind. I'm curious like are there other ways in which like you wish there were something whether it's a tool or or something else to help you with these like mindsets or to be able to like coach on this like on these particular things. Darshan Bhatt: yeah, you know, um, so I think yeah, you're explicitly asking to go into solutioning. So, Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Yes. Darshan Bhatt: yeah. So, um again, I don't know if this is the best, but off the top of my mind and kind of how I've been using the the the doc that we have in one-on- ones. It's just building that habit of constantly checking in on that Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: because you know like often

it this none of this is new like people know this but Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: you talk about it and you make all these little decisions along the way and you end up here and you're like oh wait we were supposed to go there 00:10:11 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah, Darshan Bhatt: like Shy Goodarzi: it's Darshan Bhatt: what Shy Goodarzi: those Darshan Bhatt: happened? Shy Goodarzi: data points, right? And it's like that's such an interesting idea or this thought where it's like how can I be reminded to talk about these things and have check-ins Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: about the this these key pieces of honestly it it does tie back to performance, right? It's something that you want your team to be better at, right? So, how do how does that become more tactical in Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: like it's not like beginning of the quarter, end of the quarter, and those are the only two Darshan Bhatt: Exactly. Shy Goodarzi: data points you Darshan Bhatt: Exactly. Shy Goodarzi: get, right? Okay. Really interesting. Oh my god. And also, um, this is hilarious because I was thinking behaviors and mindsets. I'm like, should we give them a manage plan? Darshan Bhatt: Yes. Building a habit of checking in on your OKRs basically, right? Shy Goodarzi: Perfect. Um, we've solved our problems. 00:11:01 Shy Goodarzi: Um I this is okay. Well, there's so many more questions. Is there do is there something that you spend a decent amount of time on that you feel is low value? Darshan Bhatt: recently. It's hard to say if it's low value though. I feel like we got there because of a lot of decisions along the way, but um spending a lot of time, repeated time talking about things that can't change, Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Darshan Bhatt: right? It's like I get it and there's there's some value in there, but shifting that mindset not, you know, it's like this could have been better, this could have been better, this could have Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: been better. It's like yes, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: it's done. Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Darshan Bhatt: How do Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Darshan Bhatt: you Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Darshan Bhatt: move forward Shy Goodarzi: Like the Darshan Bhatt: from Shy Goodarzi: forward Darshan Bhatt: here? Shy Goodarzi: movement. Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. So Shy Goodarzi: That's Darshan Bhatt: it's 00:12:22 Shy Goodarzi: really interesting. Okay. Darshan Bhatt: yeah it's um I'm trying to think that that was and you know a lot of like meta data here and digging in I am equating value with progress and that felt like the lowest progress Shy Goodarzi: Okay. That's interesting. Um, what are the biggest communication hurdles you face with your team or other teams? Darshan Bhatt: Yeah, it's are are the words we're using do they mean the same thing when I say them as

when you say them? Um knowing Shy Goodarzi: Structured Darshan Bhatt: they Shy Goodarzi: learning Darshan Bhatt: don't. Yeah, exactly. It's like knowing they don't. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: So I think there's this especially recently there's been a heightened um and and we're making we are making progress but I would say what's gotten what's gotten in the way is we use the same word to mean different things. And Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: quite literally like for Shy Goodarzi: Different. Darshan Bhatt: example Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: cohort means like three different things and Shy Goodarzi: Yes. 00:13:45 Darshan Bhatt: they're very different Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Darshan Bhatt: based on the same concept but Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: very different things. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yes. The shared language Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: has has not been great recently, Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: especially on the technical side. Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Um, got it. And Okay. Uh, changing directions just a little bit. How do you currently support the growth and development of your team members? Darshan Bhatt: So, uh, one thing I use is our career leveling guide that we have Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Darshan Bhatt: at Budro. So, I kind I use that, um, and then also I I haven't done it as much recently, but um, every quarter doing um, having the team do a 360 basically. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Darshan Bhatt: Um, Shy Goodarzi: Good. Darshan Bhatt: so I would say those are uh, yeah, so in one-on- ones bringing up the leveling guide and just talking about it Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Darshan Bhatt: and then in um, u quarterly doing the the 360s and then debriefs from those 00:14:57 Shy Goodarzi: Is there anything today that you would say is challenging um in giving feedback, managing performance or having career conversations? Darshan Bhatt: Yeah, I think giving feedback um especially 360 Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Darshan Bhatt: is challenging and it's and I say that just broadly Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: providing good feedback um providing actionable and I'm just quality ifying good a little bit more so it's not so ambiguous. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Darshan Bhatt: Um providing actionable and feed actionable and in service of the person receiving feedback. That type of feedback is difficult. And then of course keeping it objective and all of that. Um it's it's just it's challenging. Shy Goodarzi: And can I ask like is this like a gonna sound bad for friends? Is this like a you thing where it's like Darshan Bhatt: Oh, Shy Goodarzi: it feels challenging for you or do you feel like it is hard at better up or Darshan Bhatt: it's Shy Goodarzi: both? Darshan Bhatt: it's challenging for me, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: but it's just it's challenging more broadly because Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. 00:16:21 Darshan Bhatt: um it's not a muscle we've uh um we've been trained on, right?

uh providing Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: providing the type of feedback that actually helps someone grow. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: There's Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: feedback. A lot of people provide feedback. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: But yeah, Shy Goodarzi: So, I'm hearing it's kind of like it's it's cultural and it's structural as well of like the business doesn't really help us identify like this is important Darshan Bhatt: yeah. Shy Goodarzi: and how to do Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: it and ways to do it. Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: And on top of that, it is a hard thing to do. Darshan Bhatt: It's Shy Goodarzi: Like Darshan Bhatt: a Shy Goodarzi: I Darshan Bhatt: it's Yeah. It's a very hard process, right? because you it's like it requires a lot of EQ um Shy Goodarzi: Yes. Darshan Bhatt: and IQ, Shy Goodarzi: And context Darshan Bhatt: right? Shy Goodarzi: and like Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: There's Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: just 00:17:06 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: it requires a lot to do it properly. Um yeah, and for for what it's worth, it's I you know in in my history better probably does it better than most and we are still I think leaf so much. Shy Goodarzi: far from where we want it. No, they Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: hear you. Um, you mentioned a little bit about the the tools that you use, but I'm going to ask it pretty directly. What tools do you currently use to manage your team? Could be spreadsheets, could be like what you the job leveling or 360, like what are what are the tools that you're using? Darshan Bhatt: Um, it is it's mainly uh Shy Goodarzi: Cool. Darshan Bhatt: Google Docs, so like just shared docs um uh for one-on-one notes and um and workday. When we do the 360, we use the 360 from workday, which I I I do want to start using our 360. Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Darshan Bhatt: Um, but that one as of now doesn't allow me to kick it off for my direct report, 00:18:13 Shy Goodarzi: interest Darshan Bhatt: which which I I mean I have so many feelings by the way. Like I think workday does it the wrong way. I think we do it the right way, but we have our Shy Goodarzi: the whole Darshan Bhatt: own Shy Goodarzi: thing. Darshan Bhatt: issues. So like I didn't want that comment to be like, oh, like no, that was not what that comment was meant to be. Shy Goodarzi: Got it. Darshan Bhatt: It just Shy Goodarzi: Um, Darshan Bhatt: that's something I I can action on. Shy Goodarzi: okay. Uh, okay. Fun questions. Do you have access to the kind of data you need to manage effectively? Or said in a different way, is there any data or reporting or insights that would

help you be a better manager? Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. If one of the things that would be great is the things we've finished if it was easy to set it up to get the impact data for that automatically. Um right now it's all poll Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Darshan Bhatt: in in some case it's not even easy poll 00:19:25 Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Darshan Bhatt: it's like difficult pull. So, it would be great if and I know we actually can um but maybe we just don't have a clear process for it. Being able to automate that and like Shy Goodarzi: of Darshan Bhatt: you know Shy Goodarzi: like, hey, Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: we did this thing and here was the impact of the business to be able Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: to like Darshan Bhatt: And it just like it constantly comes back, right? Like uh for example, unless I pull it, I have no idea how many RCG Mobile members there are. Or or Disney. like I have it's it's pull and it's uh even then it's like not quite the Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: best pull Shy Goodarzi: Okay. It's a really that's a really interesting idea. Um, if you Okay, we're getting into solutioning. If you could design a tool just for managers or for yourself as a manager, what would it help you do? Darshan Bhatt: It would help me make the implicit more explicit. 00:20:47 Darshan Bhatt: And oh, and this is like really high level. Shy Goodarzi: What? Darshan Bhatt: Maybe we can dig in deeper. Um, make the uh implicit explicit and then also very explicitly support my team in navigating ambiguity. Um, and like you know with all the the the stuff that comes along with that like yes it's difficult, yes it's frustrating. Yes, you're going to get it wrong. All of that's okay. It's part of the process. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Okay. Um, can you tell me more what you mean by um taking what's implicit and making it explicit? Can you give me an example of that? Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. So um implicit is the impact that any person on the team is working towards should tie up somehow to our or goals. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: Um it's kind of honestly it's more implicit here in most cases. In some cases it's explicit like you know sell manage to ex customer. That's pretty, you know, if Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: every time we do a launch, we're 00:22:10 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: meeting that helping meet that goal. Um, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: but that's that's not our normal TPS. It's it's a little less direct. Um, Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Darshan Bhatt: and so it's a little less explicit. You have to like kind of like, Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: yeah, you're you're helping this. It's like, how? Well, you know, you are. And there's creating a

clear tie in there. Um Shy Goodarzi: Okay. Darshan Bhatt: and you know like previously I've I have seen um you you can do this with I think anything it just levels but uh um MBOs where they did that all the way down. So it was like Shy Goodarzi: else. What's that? Sorry. Darshan Bhatt: manage by objective. So it's not I mean it's not that different from a lot of what we do but what we don't do well is letting that um like flow through at all levels Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: um very explicitly. So it's like you know CEO MBOS's you can think of that the org 00:23:15 Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Darshan Bhatt: ts and then the direct reports of the CEO get their own MBOs based on the CEO's objectives Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Darshan Bhatt: and then these objectives get broken down further and further and further and further until literally every individual has their objective that they could literally trace up the route from Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Darshan Bhatt: their managers. Shy Goodarzi: And can you tell me tell me more about what you think that will do? Like what what is that helping? Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. So, it's like the impact has a very clear tie-in because the objective that that impact is after presumably would fall into this hierarchy. Shy Goodarzi: And what would it help us prevent? Like what is the what is again this uh it sounds like we're having trouble with something and I'm trying to Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: get at what that problem is. Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. I think we have a question around and we we could pull it up um from Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Darshan Bhatt: our workday um or pean right it's something like the work I do moves the orc forward or something 00:24:17 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: along those lines Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Darshan Bhatt: I think it's that it's having that very explicit tie into the work I do Shy Goodarzi: H. Darshan Bhatt: the impact I have because it really shouldn't be about the activity Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Darshan Bhatt: the impact I have moves the org forward Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: and it's like people you know depending on where you are in the org you can say yes no um but it's it's not a clear tiein. It's like I am loosely associated with tree one. Shy Goodarzi: Do you think that that would uh like change the prioritization of what people are actually working on? Darshan Bhatt: I mean, yeah, it absolutely should, right? Like, yeah, it it the way that that would flow is it's like, okay, I see this Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: is the now you can have other impact, but like, Shy Goodarzi: Mhm. Darshan Bhatt: you know, this is Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: the main thing you're doing Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. So Darshan Bhatt: and

Shy Goodarzi: interesting. Darshan Bhatt: here's why. because your boss, 00:25:12 Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: their boss, like here are the, you know, it's basically like the the Yeah. It's the objectives really getting down to an individual level Shy Goodarzi: It Darshan Bhatt: and Shy Goodarzi: also Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: it keeps leadership accountable like you can't change your MBOS's every Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: every Darshan Bhatt: Right. Shy Goodarzi: month. Darshan Bhatt: Right. Exactly. That's the other thing. And and it's fine. You can, but then you need Shy Goodarzi: that Darshan Bhatt: to go Shy Goodarzi: impacts. Darshan Bhatt: through that process. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: Okay. I know we're one minute away. Last question for you is, how do you currently use AI as a manager? And do you? Darshan Bhatt: Yes. Um to help with career conversations. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah. Darshan Bhatt: Um so I get you kind of like role play but not not ex exclusively so. Um um and then also I don't know if this counts but um just encouraging my team to use AI to improve 00:26:18 Shy Goodarzi: That's fair. Darshan Bhatt: um and so that's like thinking that you know just thinking as very specific um as a manager also with strategy kind of bouncing ideas so to speak um uh and and turning that strategy into tactics and you know and then of course h after all that idea capturing that and documenting that. So I would say just every step of the way for that Shy Goodarzi: got it. Okay. Um well, thank you so much for your time and this was super helpful and insightful and many of the things you you said I think are shared across like many managers and then there are some things that are like very specific I feel like to are like where you are in the or I like I think I'm going to see that of like patterns that feel like it's cross crosscutting and then there's going to be like function specific Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: stuff that Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: is going to come out but I'm um I will share out more of what I find from this and it's really just trying to understand managers better Darshan Bhatt: Yeah. Shy Goodarzi: this was super helpful. Darshan Bhatt: Yes yeah, thank you for the conversation. Shy Goodarzi: Yeah well I'll see you soon. Darshan Bhatt: See ya.
