Sam Ryu envisions an ideal manager tool for automated time prioritization and coaching prompts, already leveraging AI like ChatGPT and Gemini for various tasks. Details Current Role and Responsibilities Sam Ryu described their current role leading key accounts teams within customer success. This team focuses on driving adoption and maturity for the company's top-line revenue among 13 to 14 key accounts. Their responsibilities include innovating platform delivery, adoption, and value realization, as well as understanding long-term customer requirements. The team comprises customer success managers, client delivery directors, specialized IPMs, and solution engineers, spanning pre- to post-sales activities (). Management Experience and Challenges Sam Ryu has been in a management role for seven years and currently manages 10 individual contributors. They noted that the wide scope for leaders at their company stage requires solving many problems, which offers a broad view but can make prioritization difficult (). Sam Ryu expressed that while people are willing to solve problems, clarity on ownership and investment in solutions needs improvement (). The top two to three challenges they face as a manager are capacity, managing four functions with 10 people, and prioritization across a broad scope of responsibilities (). Influence, Tools, and Processes Sam Ryu feels they have conviction in their decisions and don't let company boundaries limit what needs to be done (). While not building formal tools, Sam Ryu focuses on defining processes and allowing teams autonomy to create their own supporting tools (). They identified low-value activities as dealing with operational issues like compensation accuracy and spending excessive time daily deciding which meetings to attend (). Sam Ryu prioritizes based on what will advance critical monthly goals, considering business context, mandates, team support, and objectives (). Team Alignment and Communication Sam Ryu ensures team alignment with company goals through consistent communication in one-on-ones and team meetings, with less frequent reinforcement of vision in team settings to ensure prior alignment. They connect individual goals to broader company missions in one-on-ones (). Sam Ryu does not perceive any significant communication hurdles with their team or other teams due to their open communication style (). Team Growth and Development Sam Ryu supports team growth by initially understanding individual motivations and passions in one-on-ones before discussing professional goals. Subsequent one-on-ones focus on coaching individuals on actions needed to achieve their goals and how Sam Ryu can provide support (). They collaboratively develop six to

nine-month roadmaps aligning activities with career aspirations and maintain open communication beyond scheduled meetings. Sam Ryu noted the importance of direct reports leading their one-on-ones for increased job fulfillment (). Tools for Team Management and Data Needs Sam Ryu primarily uses Vitality and Salesforce to manage their team, focusing on account data rather than micro-level task tracking due to the seniority of their team members (). They rely on personal observations, such as lack of communication or surfacing risks, to identify when closer inspection is needed. Sam Ryu finds their notebook incredibly helpful and acknowledges that broader-scale management in previous roles involved tools like Asana (). While feeling they have necessary data, Sam Ryu desires a real-time pulse on team morale beyond quarterly surveys and better reports on pacing against various performance factors (). Ideal Manager Tooling and AI Usage If Sam Ryu could design a tool for managers, it would help prioritize their time automatically or identify areas of excessive time investment. They also suggested a feature that acts like a coach, prompting managers to consider their time allocation (). Sam Ryu is interested in adopting innovations like Superblocks, which allows building automations and workflows across applications using prompts (). Currently, Sam Ryu uses AI, including ChatGPT and Gemini, to refine communication, build meeting storylines, conduct research, and create small automations (). They believe the key to manager tooling adoption lies in seamless flow of work across different devices and contexts (). Suggested next steps No suggested next steps were found for this meeting.

Can you describe your current role and what your team is responsible for? Deep. Um, so current role, I help lead our key accounts teams within customer success. We are responsible for leading the adoption and maturity for our topline revenue for the company. which means it's focused to about 13 to 14 specific key accounts. our top paying customers within BetterUp. And our goal is to not only incubate and innovate on what does the future of platform delivery and adoption and value realization look like for better up but it's also to help us understand in this new way of platform for better up what does that mean to what our customers require of us long term. Yeah. Is that helpful? Yes. and very important work. Yes. Um to be more specific, it spans across four teams. Okay. Um customer success managers, client delivery directors, specialized IPMs, and um solution engineers. And we sit from pre-sales to post sales across our key account segment. 00:01:24 Sam Ryu: Yes. I really hope you grow your team, please. Um how long have you been in a manage management role? This company or just overall? Overall, seven years. Okay. And currently, how many people do you manage?

10. And are they is it a mix of IC's and managers or one or the other? All IC's. All IC's. Great. Um, and have you managed in other organizations? Clearly, you've managed in other organizations before. If so, how does this experience compare? I would say that based off the stage of the company that we are in, our scope as leaders is very wide, which means we're solving for a lot more problems. Um, there's pros and cons to that. Pros, you get a much wider view into what's happening on the ground level in terms of what's going on with the business and with your teams. I think the cons of that is you struggle to prioritize what problems to solve. Yeah. 00:02:37 Sam Ryu: And my experience here so far is that people are very willing, very open to solving a lot of problems. We sometimes don't know how to communicate what problem we're solving for and who's responsible for it. So I think my experience overall as I'm speaking out loud and brainstorming and venting yes feels like we need to do a better job of getting crystal clear on who is solving for the problem. We all know the problems that exist. Yeah. But who ising for the problem? Yeah. And how are we investing in it is the question that I ask myself as a leader here more than I did at previous companies. you know, previous companies because of the stage. Again, we're series E, but we we kind of operate like a series A. Um, series B. I series A, not series A. Series A is like Yeah, series B. Sorry, I don't need like series B. Um, is in other companies when I'm in those positions, it's been we're investing in these directions. Here's how we need to go and execute for the most part. 00:03:46 Sam Ryu: Mhm. And here it's we're figuring out still what we're investing in because our product is not sticky enough. So let's go and bring back the data which is a sticky which is like a it's a it's a cloudy space to be in and it's also not a space for everybody to be into. Totally. So like you also have to recognize as a leader once you're in that position is this is this the position I want to be into? Totally. So yes. Yes. Yeah. Um, okay. Zooming out more to kind of understanding current challenges. Can you tell me what the top two to three challenges you face as a manager right now? Capacity and prioritization. Amazing. And how can you tell me a little bit more about what like those challenges specifically? Yeah, I mean best practices any leader shouldn't have anywhere from should only have five to six IC's max. Um, also one to two functions. Yes, I have I have over those by double. 00:04:46 Sam Ryu: Yes. So, four functions, 10 people. Oh my gosh.

So, that's the capacity issue which means that your team engagement results like PCON will be poor in management support because they don't feel like they have enough of your time. Yeah. That's also a skill problem sometimes because obviously some of your IC's are better at reaching out and communicating versus some are not. But it's also on an organization to invest in developing your people. So it's not unfair feedback. Okay. Um so that's the capacity piece. In terms of prioritization, when you have four functions across pre-to post sales and again your breadth is very large, you have to be very targeted every week on like what problem you're not solving for, just inching along totally to solve for like it's not even solving for it. It's just like how do we how do we just make 0.5% of a step here? Um, yeah. And I think those are the two that you wrestle with. Okay. 00:05:42 Sam Ryu: Yeah. Um, are there particular areas of your team's performance or development that you feel hardest to influence? Oo, that's a great question. Hardest to influence meaning I feel like I don't have enough influence to grow these areas. Yes. Or you feel like you don't have the tools or support to be able to do that? No, I actually don't think so. Not me. Not me personally. I feel that I have I work with a lot of con conviction once I make a decision. And I don't really let the boundaries of a corporate company tell me what those things are. I just need to do what needs to be done. Yeah. So, I don't really feel that way. Yeah. Um I also feel like as a leader, if you don't have tools, you kind of create the tools that you need. Yeah. So, have you done like have you built any tools for yourself or have you kind of yeah hacked stuff together to get what you need? 00:06:47 Sam Ryu: This is exposing some good qu this is like it's making me think about good things because I think key accounts is so innovative in services that we don't really have standard ways yet of doing things. So I haven't been building tools per se, but building this is what the process should be and communicating it out and allowing the teams to have the autonomy to build the right tools to support them. Okay. And not being very directive and we have to choose one or the other. Let's more be playful about what we're building. Here's the outcome we're trying to drive for. Great. What I thought about when you asked that was more like upward feedback. Yes. And that's not about tools. It's just about being very honest and directive about what you need. And that's where I feel like I don't need don't need any Okay. tools or help with. Okay. Does that make sense? It does. It does. It

does. 00:07:36 Sam Ryu: Um, what do you currently spend the most time on that you feel is low value? Um I think at our stage of company like dealing with people's comp if pay is actually right and captivate if we're like it's these operational things that should not be time sucks for us like I shouldn't have CSM holding a manual spreadsheet of their opportunities doing their manual calcul calcated commission and prospect referencing their paychecks for that. Wow. That's like and and dealing with things like that is not obviously a great use of time. So like little operational things. Okay. I would say probably for the purpose of this question. Yeah. Um I was initially going to say prioritizing my time because of workload and amount of people but I actually think it's a good exercise for me actually week in and week out to do. I think what is low value is like choosing what meeting to be every day. Like every morning I'll wake up and I'll spend 30 minutes like what meetings do I decline? 00:08:49 Sam Ryu: What meetings do I actually attend? Yes. If I had priorities set automatically each week and it did it for me. Whoa. That's a tool. Product idea. That's a tool. Nailed it. That would be incredible. Okay. Um today, how do you go about prioritizing? Like do you just like think about it? make a list for yourself like that kind of thing. I go back to the question of what's going to push the needle on the thing that needs to push in this month. Okay. So, I think about the weeks and milestones. So, if I know I'll think about it in milestones and then in my in my team like who needs me this week? Who needs to see me? Who needs to get my guidance? Like who's asked for support, eyes, hands, ears, and in what areas. Okay. Um, I also try and cross reference that with where we are within the business. 00:09:42 Sam Ryu: So, if Disney feels, okay, we just launched, I can kind of take my foot off the gas at Disney and not join because I have Jess in these calls and yada yada. Yes. I'm dare to like I I'll kind of do the weighing of four things as I talk about this. Business context Uhhuh. versus business mandate. Okay. Team support. Okay. And then final is like objectives we're trying to push towards. Those four will probably dictate how I prioritize in the morning. Okay. And that's like a jazz balance. I think. Yes. And do you do it at the beginning of the week or do you do it every day? Fridays I do for Monday, Tuesday, and then by Monday morning I probably have to rechange everything. Okay. Because something's come up for Wednesday through Friday. So, I try not to do the entire week because I know things are going to

change and it's a waste of time. 00:10:36 Sam Ryu: Okay. Yeah. So helpful. Um, how do you ensure your team is aligned with broader company goals? Um, consistent communication in one-on- ones and team meetings. Okay. And you, so you host like a weekly I have a weekly team. I have a bi-weekly team meeting right now. Okay. Which I if you have to constantly reinforce your company's vision, there's a problem every two weeks. The line. So, I try not to actually speak about it more than once a month in team settings because we should be aligned on what we talked about last month. Totally. In one-on- ones, I always try and connect their individual goals to the broader, you know, missions of the company. Totally. Which is why it comes up more in one-on-one settings. Okay. I also find it more beneficial to have in one-on-one conversations because there's more uh space for to talk and discuss the ideas themselves because the objectives or missions of a company are just ideas. 00:11:28 Sam Ryu: They're not fact. So, yes. Amazing. Um, what are the biggest communication hurdles you face with your team and other teams? Communication hurdles, if you have any like in terms of timing, in terms of how I communicate, all any any of those. I don't really, as you can tell, I don't have time with communication as much. I know. I was gonna say I feel like I can talk all day. Um and there's no topic I can't I don't feel like is I can't talk about um just because it comes from a always comes from a very light place. Yeah. So I don't really have any communication with my with my team other teams. Yeah. Yeah. Not even no I feel like I can talk to other teams too but same way. I I will corroborate that from my perspective. Absolutely. Um how do you uh currently support the growth and development of your team members? So, it's I I I do it in two ways. 00:12:30 Sam Ryu: The first way is in our first one-on ones that I have a direct report, right? Because direct reports change here a lot in some cases. Every time I'm doing like our first one-on-one, I'm always trying to get gain insight into the person, okay? Not the professional yet. Because I want to understand what motivates them, what they're inspired by, what their passions are. I think if you can understand that better, you have a better question to ask towards the end of that when we talk about career goals of like what do you want to do here? Like what do you want to accomplish? Not the role. What do you want to accomplish? So I'll typically try and probe into those areas. Over the next set of one-on- ones, my asks will be like, "What do you want to do? And are you doing the things to

be able to It's very coaching, right, of what we do. Yeah. Are you doing the things that are helping you get there?" And 00:13:13 Sam Ryu: like, "How can I be hands or eyes or ears to help you get there?" Mhm. And typically once we have that, we'll typically lay out a road map for six months, nine months. Okay. Based off of what you're doing, here are the two areas it's going to help you in your career goals, help you in your aspirations. Here are not the areas that are going to. Yeah. So, here are the areas I should probably be a lot more involved with. Yeah. And the other areas actually don't really matter as much. Yeah. Um, so we'll just basically build a plan against that and we'll constantly just check in on like how I'll check in on how they're feeling towards accomplishing those goals. Yeah, doesn't happen all the time. Um, but I try and keep a very like open door if things come up outside of the one-on- ones to talk about it. Yeah. Um, I also just have a philosophy and like this is like some really interesting data that um 84% of the people that manage their one-on- ones, like they lead their one-on- ones with their leadership feel like they have more fulfillment in their jobs. 00:14:08 Sam Ryu: Interesting. So, I I don't like to I don't like to prescribe anything in our one-on- ones. I like to see how people show up. Oh, totally. And that actually gives me a much better indication of if they should be there or not. Totally. Um, is there anything that makes giving feedback, managing performance, or having career conversations challenging today? Not to me. Yeah. Passing with flying colors. Um, okay. Oh, here we go. I think we're getting kicked out. No worries. Um, it'll keep going. Yes. Okay. Okay. I'm going to move to the tooling and support needs. Okay. What tools do you currently use to manage your team? What tools do I currently use to manage my team? Vitaly. What's that? Vital is our customer success platform. It's okay. We just rolled it out. We just rolled it out probably a few months ago. 00:15:20 Sam Ryu: Okay. Or two months ago. Um, Vitaly Salesforce. Um, we have some Excel sheets that we use to manage like deployments and things of that nature, but typically vitally and Salesforce is where the majority of all of our account data lives. Okay. That tells me what we need to tell me where like all the account specific information is. Yeah. I don't track at a micro level tasks and like project management stuff. I don't project manage our because also within key accounts you have our most senior more strategic. Yes. You don't have to handhold. You shouldn't have to shouldn't have to handhold. Yeah. So I don't I don't handhold. We unless you sense unless the

caveat is like I sense I need to inspect. Okay. So that's what I want to get into. How do you know that some like what are the signals that you're gathering and where is that data for you to know when something maybe isn't going as planned or when it is? 00:16:24 Sam Ryu: when risk bubbled up of fire when fires happen, I'll inspect a little bit more. Two, I don't hear from someone in a couple weeks. If I don't hear from you in a few weeks, I don't hear like, "Here's what's going on here." Just like kind of communicating, I'll I'll say like, "Why are going on?" Okay. Why haven't I heard from you in a few weeks? Okay. Usually is a telling sign of like things are something's weird. Something's off. Okay. And is there a tool that you currently use, whether it's a spreadsheet or something else, that you feel is incredibly helpful to you? my notebook. I'm very like I'm I don't I don't really use a tool. That's so interesting. I don't really use a Do other managers use tools? Should I be using a tool? Did I fail? Did I fail on this one? You know, I'm like, okay, so in this world of AI, right, part of how helpful it can be is the data that you can give to it. 00:17:14 Sam Ryu: Yes. And when it's all in this notebook, does that make everything more manual for you? No. Because when I'm managing people, I don't think there's I'll eat my own words later, but um I don't think I need a database of like information to tell me how to like manage a person. Okay. When it gets to that level. Okay. Does that make sense? It does. It does. Yeah. I will say though, so this is probably more helpful. Yeah. In another organization where I had layers, I had directors underneath me with other teams. Okay. I use tools like a sauna and things like that. Okay. To at a broader scale be able to understand what people are working on and inspect in those ways, right? But now you're at this. Okay. If I showed you what was in vitally, vital is a pretty good indicator indicator of like team performance, who's working on what. Also in this context for the recording, yeah, being in the retention business, being in the NR business, yeah, your work is dictated by your book. 00:18:23 Sam Ryu: Y your book is dictated by your expansion opportunities. So like you kind of know where work should be okay pushed into. Yeah. Um yeah, I'm just going to make a note because this is this is making me think about something now. Okay, great. And I love this. You have such nice handwriting. I do. Thank you, Shy. What? That is great. Thank you. I appreciate it. Okay. So, it sounds like you answered this question. Do you

have access to the kind of data you need to manage effectively? And you're saying you have that. Okay. I do. Um, are there any kinds of insights or reports that would help you be a better manager? Yes. Let's talk about it. Yes. If I had I would love more of a real time pulse on how my teams are feeling. Not peon results that are once a quarter, okay? 00:19:25 Sam Ryu: But like true honest like we we get on Friday team calls and it's Friday and it's happy Friday two check-in and people are like tired or like energetic or and like that's great but I get it. It's a team call. We're rah rahrrah on Friday. Totally. I would love an honest real time pulse on how people are feeling and what they need. Okay. So I can be more proactive about long-term support. Okay. Um, I don't know how we we would do that. Um, I think that's also kind of your job as a manager to be able to kind of sense how the team is. Yeah. Um, a better report. I'm thinking more better up specific, but like pacing like how are we pacing against the goals? Yeah. and pacing against the outcomes we set at the beginning of the year or beginning of the quarter or like we pace in these metrics that are connected to the organization which are great I think that's easy through line yeah but are there other like opfs other performance factors that we have that we should be tracking against I think there are like in large organizations there always are totally but the way they track them is opaque yeah so I that would be okay that would be helpful but it comes back to our previous conversation of prioritization and time like what problems are we solving for Like we have like Yeah. 00:20:44 Sam Ryu: If I'm a If I'm a CS leader, Yeah. I'm probably focused on just expanding my book. Totally. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Um, a couple more questions for you. If you could design a tool just for managers, what would it help you do? Prioritize their time automatically. I liked that idea we talked about earlier. Yeah. Um, or well, it's prioritize their time. Mhm. Yeah. Or help them identify where they are spending too much time. You mean as a manager? Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. I noticed you were in Yes. 60% of your meetings this week were in Disney. Should you be focused there? I love this. Any other thoughts there? Yeah. Like like kind of pushing you. Yeah. Like it'd be nice to have a almost like a coach to push you on like where you're spending your time. Time's the most. 00:21:37 Sam Ryu: I mean, this is very time. It's time. Time for managers at your level. It's like that's the number one. Number one. Okay. Um, are there any changes or innovations

in the way teams are managed that you'd like to see your company adopt? Yes. Tell me more. I have a demo actually with Superblocks in three weeks. Superblocks is a company that I don't know about the rails, but essentially what they do is they're like an internal service layer or internal interface to all of the applications that are within an organization. Okay. And you can build automations and process workflows with just gender like just prompts. Wow. So I can say like I use vital Salesforce and this for this process. Build me an app for this and it'll build the like. So, I think what I'd love to do is figure out I mean this is being recorded but like yeah I can also turn it off if you want to and I don't have to like it's not it it wouldn't record but I'd have the idea and I wouldn't link it back to you. 00:22:41 Sam Ryu: Okay. If you can Yeah. Um okay last question and then um I think that is it but um how like are you currently using AI in managing how so? Um I use chat I mean I use AI to do a few things bounce off my own communication talk track ideas on how I communicate the ideas to like performance reviews one-on- ones things like that. Yeah. Um, I use it to build storylines of how I frame and set up context to meetings. If I'm kicking off a meeting, I'll use it to like help me understand how to frame this in a way the audience. So, I'll say I have a product person, a salesperson, and a leader in the call. Here's my talk track. How would I reframe it to make sure that they all feel like they're seen and part of the conversation? So, I do it to really test my own thinking. Okay. Um, I'll then do it to do a lot of like research on companies, get up to date on like how I'm thinking about the future of how things are going to be architected. 00:24:13 Sam Ryu: Um, and then lastly, I'll stress test it on um my own like automations. Like I'll build like little small automations to help me like manage my inbox or manage like things that are being very cluttered. Okay, that's the way that I use it today. And what do you use? ChatGpt, Gemini. I'll use Zapier because Zapier is just like an easy way to just connect certain tools to um that's really what I use today. I mean the thing about a leader like I think there's types of leaders in departments. Product leaders for example are still very hands-on like they still have to get a lot of hands-on work done. I do as well, but it's more it's more relational work. Yes. It's like clearing the way. Yeah. It's like clearing the way or it's like customer work.

It's not like I'm not building reports every day. I'm not um I'm not in the better platform and admin panel. I'm not like I'm not in those things. 00:25:23 Sam Ryu: I'm assessing and viewing and yes figuring out how to architect and doing org design and like but yeah, you know what I mean? Like that work is like so like I don't know it's relational. Yeah. If I really got like I don't know how GBT would do that work. Yeah. Like I the end work but the brainstorm discovery to that is very Yeah. Like it's very it's very discovery and very blocked by other people's times. I can't just go do it right now. I want to do it in a day. Like I I have I got to be with Brian in a few days. I gota be like I just I walked all by other people's times. So um okay final question then we will end this. This is the most this was like the this is it. Fantastic. Um is there anything else you would want to share in this line of thinking around manager tooling? Manager tooling. What else I would share? 00:26:27 Sam Ryu: Um, I think flow of work for managers is is going to be your key to adoption. If I'm on I'm on the road. I got to go from flight to flight. I got to go from phone to laptop. Phone like, you know, a laptop speaker and camera to off to like Yeah. If I think about how I just navigate my own technology, yeah, how it seamlessly funnels through that I think is the company that figures out flow of work for managers in manager tooling will win. Okay, that's I I strongly believe that because I always think about like sometimes I won't answer something on Slack on the road because I know I have two minutes to get somewhere and this might take five minutes. it telling I'll just wait like all like damn like Patrick Pinky, but I know Patrick's pings are this long so I need to yes. Wait till I get to a laptop. Yeah. But what if I didn't? Yeah, would I be able to continue my train of thought from like easily seamlessly? Just begin to it, just stick it. Yeah I mean so okay. Um well thank you so much. Yeah, no problem. This is the best. Transcription ended after 00:27:47 This editable transcript was computer generated and might contain errors.
